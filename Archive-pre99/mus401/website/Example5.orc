Remember that the;amplitude of the modulator is called the "deviation" and that the size of this;value has no effect on the loudness of the sound, but rather effects the number;and quality of the side-bands (see your text for further explanations of the;relationship between the size of the deviation and the number of side-bands).;Since the deviation uses the same envelope as the carrier's amplitude, the;number of side-bands will become greater as the sound gets louder, and the;number of side-bands will decrease as the sound gets softer. This can be used;to approximate a phenomenon of natural sounds which have more partials when;they are louder than when they are softer.icarfreq = p6iratio = p7imodfreq = icarfreq * iratioindex = p8idev = imodfreq*indexiamp = p4 * 32000iampfunc = p5kenv    oscil1i 0, 1, p3, iampfuncamod    oscili  idev * kenv,  imodfreq,  1acar    oscili  iamp * kenv,  icarfreq + amod,  1        out acarendin
