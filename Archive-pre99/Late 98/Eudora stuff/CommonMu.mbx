This now works in clisp (and gcl and cmu-cl).  Other news:
the save-state mechanism in Snd can save the current edit
lists (so you can stop in mid-career and restart later);
asf headers are readable (but every example I have is either
mpeg-3 data or some propietary adpcm kludge); the lisp-generated
graph (Snd) now has hooks for user-defined editing/display hacks;
if you have the XmHTML widget (http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/XmHTML),
Snd can use it in its help dialog; more examples in Snd's
examp.scm (an equivalent of the emacs "buffers" menu, special
key handlers, etc); in cmn the line-separation message can
apply to staves, various other minor bugs fixed.

I don't understand this one at all. All I'm doing is to attempt to list
the contents of  a container that has more than one owner. Why is this a
problem? 

Do any of you CLISP users run into this? I wonder if it is somehow
related to the error-level nesting bug (although I can't imagine how).

I've gotten cm/clm/snd up and running on my old '486/66 (with RedHat 5.1,
OSS driverand SB16 card). My problem is that the audio signal from clm
(and snd too) is discontinuous and choppy even on short files that
shouldn't really tax the system that much. Is it possible for me to adjust
the buffer size used by the programs to compensate for my slower
processor? I saw something about buffers in "defaults.lisp" but didn't
want to blunder around in the code without at least half a clue as to what
I'm doing. 

Can I solve this on my current system or do I just need to save up my
lunch money to buy a faster box?

 Hi,
 I am new at this list but was glad when I found it - so I will not 
 be quite alone when problems with cm will arise. 
 I am using cm on linux and missed a function to visualize lists of 
data  as a graph. So I wrote the lisp function cm->gnuplot.
This function is an interface to gnuplot.
It is simply called with a list of numbers as its argument.
Its rather simple so far but perhaps useful for anybody.

						Torsten Anders

;;; The function ´cm->gnuplot´ is an interface to gnuplot to visualize a list
;;; of data (integers, ratios, reals) as a graph. I wrote it because
;;; I am running cm on a linux/unix platform without any graphics. 
;;; It is simply called with a list of numbers as its argument. If the key 
;;; argument :smooth? is set to T, the 
;;; numbers are interpolated. 
;;; examples: (cm->gnuplot (test-function1))
;;;           (cm->gnuplot (test-function2) :smooth? t)
;;; The function creates two temporary files (fix path if necessery) and calls 
;;; xterm to run gnuplot (so you need gnuplot too, but it should be on your 
;;; linux cd).
;;; Its rather simple so far but perhaps useful for anybody.

[For CM users using MIDI realtime I/O under ACL on SGI's only]


Due to an oversight, the cm.tar.gz archive on ccrma contained 

an outdated version of libmi_d.so and mi_d.lisp.  I've just 

uploaded a new archive with the correct versions:

-rw-r--r--    1 hkt      user      941303 Aug 25 09:03 cm-1.3.tar.gz
lrwxrwxrwx    1 hkt      user          13 Aug 24 06:33 cm.tar.gz ->
cm-1.3.tar.gz

which is also symlinked from cm.tar.gz.

If you have already downloaded cm.tar.gz and are planning to use
MIDI realtime I/O in ACL, you should either

  [A] Replace cm-1.3/midi/bin/sgi/libmi_d.so and cm-1.3/midi/mi_d.lisp
      with the newer libmi_d.so and mi_d.lisp from 


        http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/CCRMA/Software/mi_d/doc/dl.html

      (Remember to choose the "Save the link As..." option)

or

  [B] Download the the source archive

        ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/Lisp/cm/sources/cm.tar.gz


If you are not sure, which version of libmi_d.so you have, cd to your
Common Music directory and execute the following commands

  % elfdump -L midi/bin/sgi/libmi_d.so | grep IVERSION
  [33]    IVERSION    Mi_D 1.3.0, Mon Aug 24 12:14:53 PDT 1998
  % grep '$Revision' midi/mi_d.lisp
  ;;; "$Revision:    1.3$"

The returned strings should match the ones above exactly.

another idea would be to write a "meta-instrument".  since
clm is basically music V, one could write an instrument
that patches its UG's in runtime according to an "orchestra" 

script, very similar to csound.  i've done that a while ago 

to some extent and with nice results.  in my case i was able
to avoid recompilation for long times.

Hi, its not a bug but its poorly documented. The call to Open a copy
stream is slightly different in 1.3 (I made it consistent with opening
things like multi-streams). Try:


	Stella [Top-Level]: open copy-stream

	Stream: #<<Copy-Stream: Copy-Stream-2>


	Stella [Top-Level]: 


if you want give the stream a name you do

<x-rich>I've put a new release of Common Music (1.3) on ccrma's ftp server. if
you use acl in linux the world has changed a bit so you might want to
look at cm-1.3/doc/install.html on how to start up acl with a cm image.



Here are the main new feature in the release:


Features and bug fixes from CM 1.3 


o New tempo objects side effect output streams for dynamic global 

tempo changes. Tempo objects can also be written to output files. 

See new Timing and Tempo entries in the dictionary. 


o New class Multi-Stream supports multiple file and file 

types being managed simultaneously during output processing 


o New VRML output syntax. This is as of yet experimental and not 

a syntax option but the file can be compiled/loaded by hand.

Feedback  is greatly appreciated. See cm/kernel/vrml.lisp. 


o New Meter and Key classes implement meter changes and key 

signatures, useful for working with output syntaxes like CMN and 

MIDI. See dictionary entries for more information. 


o midifile-import completely rewritten to better support Level 1 

MIDI files. midifile-import now allows data to be imported either 

in logical or raw time formats, allows any subset of tracks to be 

imported at once, allows any set of channel and/or meta opcode 

types to be skipped on a per channel basis, etc. See the new 

entry in the dictionary. 


o All MIDI messages types are now supported, as are constants for 

General MIDI patch changes, drum kit specifications, manufacturer 

ID codes, SMTP time coding, controller definitions, etc. 


o New variable *midi-gm-mode* may be set to T in order to enable 

printing of GM patches and drum kit names.


o New system patch facility automatically loads system patches. 


o New functions note-class, interval-class, and prime-form for 

working with note sets. See new entries in dictionary. 


o New interval type preserves note spelling during transposition and 

note generation within the intervals macro. All intervals up to 

doubly-augmented and doubly-diminshed within an octave are 

predefined. See the dictionary entry on definterval [Macro] for 

more information. 


o Interval streams now automatically coerce the "return values" to be 

the same type as the transposition offset specified to the pattern. 


o *chromatic-scale* now supports double sharps and flats. 


o New Parameters commmand in Stella displays object parameters. 


o New :clm-bin-directory and :cmn-bin-directory arguments to make-cm 

for loading binary files kept apart from sources. If not 

specified, these arguments default to :clm-directory and 

:cmn-directory, respectively. 


o markov-analyze now allows a null stream to be specfied, in which 

case the lisp expression that creates the markov pattern is 

returned (contributed by Jim Meehan).

yes, in MCL the "lisp side" of the definstrument (a lisp function)
doesnt have to be compiled but the definstument form still has to
reside in a file. the definstrument macro expansion makes an explicilt
check for this:


    #+(or cmu clisp mcl) (or *load-pathname* *compile-file-truename*) 

    (error "oops -- I can't find ~A's lisp source file!" name)

Unfortunately, it *is* a big problem.  

In the next version of Clisp (to be released Real Soon Now) some work
has been done towards the semplification of the FFI.  
Unfortunately, this will not solve the problem with clm.

when you ran an algorithm while a named copy stream like this was open,
a thread would appear in the top level, with the same name as the copy

Hello

I'm stuck with anoi.ins. In a way it removes noise, but then it creates
some chirpy sounds. I looked with snd the resulting file (thanks Bill)
and looks like the frequency is in many cases sr/4 or sr/3.

I've tried lms-algorithm, it removes noise to some extent, but also
the sound, a small bell got twisted too. The output doesn't sound
too bad, but looking at its spectra reveals, that some frequencies
between two adjacent, are missing.

I'd need urgently a noise reduction, because the portable recorder
(old analog) creates a lot of tape hiss.

I've seen Sound Forge (not expecting anything like that), and it really
improved me.

Quick search in the Net showed algorithms, but the ones with accurate
description were for image noise removal.

Any help appreciated

thanks

Hi,

I just downloaded the 10 Aug 98 version of CLM and ran into a problem when
trying to compile it on a Power Mac 9500 running OS 8.1 and MCL 4.1.  At
the very end of loading all.lisp, the following things occured:

;Compiling "9500 Internal:clm new:menu.lisp"...
;Loading #P"9500 Internal:clm new:menu.pfsl"...
;Compiler warnings for "9500 Internal:clm new:defins.lisp" :
;   Undefined function CLM::SEND-AND-RECEIVE-SND, in
CLM::DESCRIBE-C-STATE.
? (in-package :clm)
#<Package "CLM">

At this point another Listener window opened itself up and the following
message appeared:

*** Break during event processing! Standin event processor created. ***
**** Original event processor will continue when break loop exits. ****
> Error in process Initial: Can't find "c_pool_active" in shared library
"clmLib".
>                           FindSymbol error number -2802
> While executing: CCL::GET-FRAG-SYMBOL
> Type Command-. to abort.
See the RestartsI menu item for further choices.

Process aborted or resumed. This Listener may no longer be active.

I'm using the precompiled clmLib that comes in the cw folder since this
machine has Codewarrior Pro 1 (not 2 or 3) and produces tons of errors
when I try to build clmLib from scratch.  If the clmLib is the problem, I
have a newer version of CW on a different computer that I could use to
make it from scratch.

Thanks,

Mari

I dont know if anybody could be interested, but
i keep a CLM.sea and CLM.sea.hqx version on the public ftp site for my
class. It is the most recent version, working on my and other MACs.
I'm not regular in updtading it(usually end of semester or when i feel
like...)
All the files, after self exctraction, are already in with the right mac
type creator, MCL (CCL2 to be correct) for lisp files and Code Warrior for
the files in the CW
directory, i.e. clm.project and ins.project.
This is the ftp address:

ftp://toto.mpap.ed.nyu.edu/pub

or "normal" anonymous ftp to:

toto.mpap.ed.nyu.edu

I think I mentioned this on this list before, but never 
really got any suggestions. Below is what happens when I generate a lisp
error in a Stella session. Saying "tl" does get me back to top-lavel, so
it's not a disaster. But very puzzling. Any ideas?

I thought it would be nice to be able to somehow graphically 
create envelopes for use as parameters to my CLM instruments.

I'm using CM/CLM and snd in Linux, using  Clisp for the CM/CLM, running
in an xemacs shell window (in case it matters).

The version of snd I'm using is the one before the latest guile-based
version. I can upgrade if it helps.

Basically, I know that I can create and edit an envelope from within
snd, and have it stored as a devfar when I save the session. I suppose I
can then write my CLM instruments to take an envelope name as a
parameter, then look through the session file for the envelope  data.

This is do-able, but I was just wondering if there is a more integrated
way of doing this already built in to the CLM-snd interface. (I didn't
see anything in the CLM doc, however, which I find is usually up to date
- thanks Bill)

Can someone suggest the most straightforward way of copying a certain
event (with all its parameters) and pasting multiple copies of it
elsewhere? AFAIK, the Stella "paste" command has no way of pasting more
than one copy of the clipboard.

I can think of a few tedious ways to do this, but I thought that I'd ask
here, in case I'm overlooking some sort of "paste-multiple" capability.

I was inserting some comments into threads,
and found that apparently the original definition of the comment class
was, well, commented out <g>, in favor of an identically-named class in
Mindy.

Since I would still like to enter comments into containers (I've been
using CM as a super-powerfull sequencer), I was thinking of restoring
the original comment class code in classes.lisp, only renaming it to
something else, like "remark".

If I do this, could it be folded in to the official CM release?
Is "remark" a name that's ok to use? 

I should say, that I'm not yet using the very recent CM release, so
maybe something's happened already.

Sorry for the off-topic post, but has anyone got SMS to run on Linux?
I'm hoping to use it with ATS under CLM.

The only sources I have seem to be only for NeXT.
In particular I need a replacement for the NeXT SND* functions to read
and write sound-files. 

I imagine these functions would be easy to cobble up, but I thought it
worth asking on this list to see if the work has already been done.

hi all - 
 
i'm thinking about buying a multi-channel (> 2) pci-soundcard
and was wondering if there's somebody out there who is using
such a card (e.g. Korg 1212, ProTools Project II, MOTU 2408)
successfully (or not) with clm/cm on a Macintosh?
 
Any information will be greatfully recieved to my private email.
 
thanks, Klaus.

This is great news for me and the Debian Snd package. If you get this
to work, I will try to include CLM in the next Debian distribution too.

Hi !

Finally Snd is now available on the Debian GNU/Linux servers and will be included
in the next Debian release scheduled for December.
The package can already be downloaded from any Debian Mirror in the distribution 
codenamed "slink". (Look at <ftp://ftp.debian.org> and / or <http://www.debian.org>).

It is propably a known problem, that keyboard shortcuts don´t work when Snd is 
compiled with lesstif. Is this a common problem with lesstif, or some sort of incompatibility between Motif and lesstif? As I see it, keyboard shortcuts could be handled by Xt too).
Anyhow, I would appreciate it, if somebody can give me a hint there, otherwise I am planning
to investigate upon this topic. Which part of the source are the keyboard shortcuts in ?

Hi everyone
I have just loaded cmn in my mac (Power 7500 upgraded with a 200Mhz 604e 

card). I can see the generated scores by using (output-type :qddirect) 

but unfortunately I can not open the resulting EPS file. I hve tried to 

it with Photoshop 3.0 and FreeHand 5.0 but without success.

Does anyone know an application to look the resulting EPS file in detail 

(some zoomming) and to print it. How can I print the scores generated 

with cmn?

Congratulations to Bill for the program
Thanks

I've just downloaded the latest snd(libc5), clm and cmn. It all builds fine

I) definstrument must be entered in a file? It wont work in a toplevel loop?

II) is there a variable to make snd open on another display from clm. I'd
like to use the
sparc-linux display next-to-me. (The sparc2 machine is slow, but the display
is big!!)

III) In cmn if i load the file hharc93.cmn I get 5 eps files. If i look at
the first
in ghostview it uses an unbelievable amount of memory and makes the machine
thrash wildly, X hardly responds and the machine nearly locks up.This a
pentium
pro with 96M/200Mhz. Is the postscript looping forever? Incidently the page
which finally appears seems to be very large with nothing on it.

IV) can you recommend any books on the techniques clm uses.

Could snd be rewritten to use gtk? Thinking about it doesnt guile
have an interface to gtk-> which means the gui could be programmed from
guile as well.......

How much work would this be?

Apologies for what are no doubt some silly introductory questions:

I am running a G3 with System 8.1, MCL 4.0 (size at 20MBs), CodeWarrior Pro
11 and trying to follow the install instructions for CLM. I have unpacked
CW.sea just fine and CW opens when I dbl-clk clm.project. However, when CW
boots the project is not present (i.e., apple-M is grayed out) making it
impossible to continue with the installation. The instructions suggest if
all else fails to get pub/lisp/cw.sea from ccrma; however, this file does
not exist.

The instructions also suggest that my reason for opening clm.project is to
build the shared library which seems to already exist. I've moved this
extension in its folder re-named clm (alias as instructed) to my extensions
folder assuming that the CLMlib is already made and then booted MCL and
eval'ed all.lisp. However, I get the error that c_pool_active cannot be
found in the shared library even when I just go to the menu. Interestingly,
I can define an instrument  but I get error #-10000 from CW when I compile
it.

I have the distinct feeling that my problems all stem from CW's inability
to recognize clm.project....

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best,

clm and cmn now work in clisp in mklinux (although
there's still no audio support, as far as I can tell).
snd compiles and loads in mklinux/lesstif, but dies --
I'll poke at this.

Snd has the first portion of an "edit history" feature,
and global-set-key.

I added the c_pool_active declaration to cmus.h (this
should not be necessary, I claim); fixed (I hope) the
MS wave (RIFF) header problem (tested in Windows 95
using the wham program); removed the reference to
cw.sea.bin (it was causing more trouble than it was
worth -- I seem to be the only person using CW 2.1);
other recent CLM changes involve the new Snd lisp
interface (the "explode" and "marks" file names had
to be changed due to a bug in the Linux support for
ms-dos file systems), and automatic shared memory allocation
in the real-time stuff.

Hmm ... it wasn.t a challenge at all ...

I realized that the topic with keyboard shortcuts isn.t that bad, because most of the time they  
work,
I will investigate when they do not.
I am planning to do excessive testing in the next days, and will hopefully find the problems
snd has with lesstif, but they seem to be few.

That vector form is causing other problems (e.g. if you're
running guile in the shared library version and want to load
C code dynamically, but need the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable to make the loader happy, then the vector form
screws up) -- I used it originally because I thought it
would be faster than the normal form; I think I'll remove
it.

Apparently so!  audio.c uses the new structs mostly as
a convenience for multi-card checks, and to get the names
of the cards (this prettifies a multi-card version of the
recorder window -- otherwise you're left guessing which
pane refers to which card).

It turns out we have a machine here running an old
Linux/libc5 system!  I've built a statically loaded
Snd for that system -- linux-snd-libc5 or linux-snd-libc5.gz
at ccrma-ftp.

I'll look at gtk -- I don't actually know anything about it.
Back when I was trying to decide what GUI-library to use for
Snd (I had hoped to use CLIM!), I don't remember gtk being 

available; I looked at tcl/tk and didn't like it (now that
I think about it, it was tcl that I really disliked,
not tk).  The X/Motif part of Snd is about 23000 lines of
C and involves hundreds of widgets, so any translation
will be tedious.  I wonder if the gain is worth the effort
(presumably lesstif will get over its current panedwindow
problems).

Guile does have a gtk interface, but also X/Xt/Xm (I think).

Matti, I have the same problem. My guess is that they've switched to
compiling with glibc (libc6). Binaries compiled that way will return the
error you specified. The 'file' command will return proper info, but
'ldd' will give the same results you got.

Ain't standards just great ?

The new version of Snd with the Guile interpreter is
(finally) available at the ccrma-ftp site (snd.tar.gz).
I'll make new pre-built images later this morning, but
they won't have guile (I don't yet know how to make a
fully statically-loaded image, so the prebuilt images
use a simple string parser for the customization stuff).
Also a new clm.tar.gz (all the clm/snd communication
functions changed as well).  I'm using guile 1.2,
available from prep.ai.mit.edu and ftp.red-bean.com/pub/guile.

I got Snd to compile in Hummingbird's X/Motif on
Windoze 95, but it wouldn't load -- probably something
trivial.

I'll make snd-2-0.rpm files early next week.

Hello,

I don't seem to be able to compile CLM in Linux (kernel 2.0.32), Redhat 5.0,
with glibc2.0.7-19. I have tried using both ACL4.3 and ACL5.0 (both of which
seem to be installed and working properly. When I load all.lisp I get the
following errors in ACL4.3 and ACL5.0 respectively;

Is the problem related to glibc, the fact that the OSS doesn't seem to be
working properly, or am I completely missing the boat with something?
I have tried compiling CM, but without CLM compiled I get other errors.
Is there a compiled binary somewhere for CLM? I can't find it at the ftp site.

Please advise! (privately if you wish - berezan@acs.ucalgary.ca).

Thanks,

    II) is there a variable to make snd open on another display from
    clm. I'd like to use the sparc-linux display next-to-me. (The sparc2
    machine is slow, but the display is big!!)

    X programs do have a way to redirect output -- something like

    'display' followed by the host -- I'll look it up somewhere.  Another
    possibility is to run on the Sun, rlogin into the other machine, run
    clm/snd there, and if all goes well, the Snd output will
    automatically appear on the Sun (that's how I run it all the time at
    home).

you can set the variable *snd-process* to a suitable command-line. eg:

   (setf *snd-process* "snd -display nice-screen:0.0")

(unfortunately this doesnt work (or does it?) with the 'vector form' used
to start snd in acl43orhigher.  I suspect this has something to do with
not passing through a shell when starting snd ??)

Hi,

Does anybody have a reliable way of writing .wav files from the  snd
editor so that they are readable by MS 3.11 applications?  So far I 

have found that the best way seems to be to use  


sox -t au <file>.snd <file>.wav 


afterwards.  (My OS is linux on a 486 PC).

Regards,
Alastair J.

Hi,

I am trying to tune the "brass" instrument in the physical modelling
toolkit.  However, it looks like the tuning can only be done in 

discrete steps of something like 2Hz (at 256Hz or so).  I found this out
by using  fm-violin  as a reference, and listening to the beats.
The latter instrument can certainly be tuned coninuously.

Does anybody know if this is unavoidable, or if there is an adjustment to the 

physical modelling source code that can be done to allow continuously-variable
tuning?  (I see that the length of the delay line looks like it must
be a discrete value).

this is a bug. i think its triggered by the fact that the editor's focus
was set to the object with two parents. until i can figure out a patch, try
listing Exposition&Thod-Vamp from outside the container, ie dont do a "go
Exposition&Thod-Vamp" and then list it. hopefully that will avoide the bug.

Seems that great minds think alike - I've also used Gnuplot from CM.

Comments on your code: 1) You seem to enjoy writing things recursively.
2) Could you explain the rounding problem?

I have found gnuplot usefull, interestingly enough, for an aid in
coercing a MIDI performance into regular rhythm values so that it can be
notated using CMN. As it happens, I have not followed through on the
project, but the technique seemed to basically work. 

What I did was to sort the performance using the rhythhm values, and
plot the result as points, with X=n and Y=rhythm(n).

Then (this is difficult to explain without a graphical example), as a
first approximation, I looked for places where there were large y-axis
jumps as clues to where to seperate the rhythm bins for purposes of
quantization for conventional notation. I found that this approach
worked very well for the short time that I made use of it. It avoided
the intense research and implementation effort that would be required
for a fully automated rhythm-interpreter, and instead showed the raw
data in a way that was conducive to common-sense and open-ended
interpretation by a human.

The final step was simply to use Stella commands to coerce the rhythm
values in a given band, into a quantized value, and then using CMN to
notate the result. Of course. Of course, the whole thing is interactive
- it may be that the tempo drifts during the performance, so I could
analyze, say, events 1:100 and then 101:200, plot them both, and then
possibly quantize based on time-varying boundaries. etc,etc.

If anyone's really interested (It's also possible that I'm not
explaining this well), I could take some time and write something up,
using a captured plot as part of the report.

Also if anyone is really interested, I could post my plotting function,
although it is definitely geared to my own specific interests, and I
spent no effort in making it general.

Well, as far as problems go, this one is only mildly annoying;

Looks like error levels (and, hence, restarts) pile up infinitely in 

your image.  Not so in mine:

  Stella [Top-Level]: (foo)

  *** - EVAL: undefined function FOO
  The following restarts are available:

  R2 = Exit Top-Level.

Anders suggested this a couple months ago, so I implemented
it in the new snd/clm -- see snd-env and clm-env in clm.html
(the current version -- the pre-guile version is too old).
I'm slaving away on this portion of the Snd/CLM right now,
so it's not completely stable.  I think none of the Snd/CLM
interface works in Clisp, but perhaps I can fix that (the
basic problem used to be that I needed some Lisp equivalent
of "select", which is missing from Clisp's implementation
of pipes, but the new version no longer needs that function).

The file-buffer-size variable in defaults.lisp refers to the buffer
used in writing data to a sound file -- it won't affect
playing sounds.  There's a section in clm.html about dac
interruptions in Linux -- there are several variables that
affect this kind of problem, but I'd try first:
(clm::set-dac-size 8192) or 65536.  If that doesn't work,
try setting the OSS "fragment" size and number via
(clm::set-oss-buffers 16 12) or perhaps even higher
numbers.  If this doesn't fix the problem, send me
whatever (describe-audio-state) prints out -- maybe
something will jump out at me.

Hi, are you using the binary release? if so, I have found a bug in the cm
initialization function that will cause patch loading to fail if the file
system has changed, which is almost surely  the case if you installed the
binaries. the bug cannot be repaired using the defpatch system itself but
its very easy to fix. After creating a cm-1.3/patches and downloading all
the patches from ccrma do:

  1) Edit the file "cminit.lisp" and add the following form to the end
     of the file:

	(load-cmpatches)

  2) Reboot Common Music.
  3) Type (cm-version)  to the Listener to verify that all patches are
     loaded. You should see something like:

	? (cm-version)
	"Common Music 1.3.0"
	304
	(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 "update0001_frame-support")

thats it. i have verified that the example works in the binary release if
all the patches are loaded:

---
Welcome to Macintosh Common Lisp Version 4.2!
? (cm-version)
"Common Music 1.3.0"

With the patch installed, I get different results from the example you

not created:

I guess two ways come to mind. First, you can copy multiple references to
the object and paste that:

Stella [Top-Level]:  copy 1,1,1,1,1
Copied Curley,Curley,Curley,Curley,Curley to Pasteboard.

Stella [Top-Level]: paste
Pasted
Curley-Copy-9,Curley-Copy-10,Curley-Copy-11,Curley-Copy-12,Curley-Copy-13
to Thread-8.

Stella [Top-Level]: list thread-8
Thread-8:
     1. #<THREAD: Curley-Copy-9>
     2. #<THREAD: Curley-Copy-10>
     3. #<THREAD: Curley-Copy-11>
     4. #<THREAD: Curley-Copy-12>
     5. #<THREAD: Curley-Copy-13>


But maybe this is what you mean by tedious. Another way would be to create
a little function:

	(defun copy-n (from n)
	  (loop repeat n collect (copy-object from)))

and then use add-object to "paste" the stuff:

	(add-objects (copy-n #!foo 10) #!bar)

Yes, this is a very strange bug in 1.3 that I believe I have fixed.
Download the file:

  ftp://ftp-ccrma.stanford.edu/pub/Lisp/cm/patches/cm-1.3.0/patch0012.lisp

put this patch in your cm/patches subdirectory and restart cm. thereafter,
when you open a copy stream and generate output the copied events should
appear as a   container in Top-Level. By default this container will be a
new thread called Copied-Output-1 (or some such name). If you want a
different name, specify it using the Receiver option when you open the
stream. You can also specify an existing  object as the receiver. Ill have
to document this better, until then here is an example that will hopefully
make things clearer:

Stella [Top-Level]: list
Top-Level:
     1. #<ALGORITHM: Foo>

Stella [Top-Level]: open copy-stream
Stream: #<Copy-Stream: Copy-Stream-1>

Stella [Top-Level]: mix foo 0

Stella [Top-Level]: list
Top-Level:
     1. #<ALGORITHM: Foo>
     2. #<THREAD: Copied-Output-8>

Again, make sure you wrap that inside set-output-stream, if you want 

subsequent mix commands to use that stream as a default:

  (set-output-stream
    (open-event-stream "/tmp/test.snd" :initialize 'channels 2 'srate
44100))

  (mix-cmd "foo 0")

I'm using that all the time in emacs :)

another, really easy, albeit slightly less efficient way of doing it would
be 


   (mix-cmd "foo,bar 0")

which is no different than typing

   mix foo,bar 0

to the Stella prompt.  Also, using the API, I often prefer


   (mix-object #!foo *output-stream* 0)


which lets me switch streams on the fly without changing the code.

hi ludi! there are two ways to do this. evey command in the interpreter
is actually implemented by a Lisp function. These functions are
consistently named <command>-CMD so to call the open command using its
function you would do:

	(open-cmd "/tmp/test.snd channels 2 srate 44100")

if you need to evaluate the "arguments" to the command, then you can use
the underlying function open-event-stream:

	(open-event-stream "/tmp/test.snd" :initialize 'channels 2 'srate
44100)

the channels and srate pairs can also be specified as keywords, ie


	(open-event-stream "/tmp/test.snd" :initialize :channels 2 :srate
44100)

when you make calls to the underlying api you have to pass objects, rather
than their names. to get an object given its name, use the #! read macro or
the find-object function (stream names are strings, though). so

Stella [Top-Level]: list
Top-Level:
     1. #<Chorale-R.1: Aus-meines-Herzens-Grunde>
     2. #<THREAD: Foo>

Stella [Top-Level]: #!foo
#<THREAD: Foo>

Stella [Top-Level]: (find-object 'Chorale-R.1)
#<Chorale-R.1: Aus-meines-Herzens-Grunde>

Stella [Top-Level]: open midi
Registering "Common Music"...
Done.
Stream: #<Midi Driver: Open>

Stella [Top-Level]: (setf x (find-object "MIDI"))
#<Midi Driver: Open>

Stella [Top-Level]: (mix-object #!foo x 1) ; same as "Mix foo 1"

>2) In the CM directory there are many *.cm files. The macintosh "kind" is

my bet is that you restored the files from a tar file -- if you take
cm-1-3.sea.bin file the macintosh file info should be preserved. you might
also be able to tell you archiver to make Lisp files when it sees the .cm
extension.

otherwise you can do somthing like:

  (dolist (f (directory "hd:lisp:cm-1.3:**:*.cm"))
    (ccl:set-mac-file-type f :TEXT)
    (ccl:set-mac-file-creator f :CCL2))

Dont load the networks.cm file into a wordprocessor, load it into CM.  it
will create a bunch of example networks.  I didnt document it because I
stopped further work on Mindy until I can figure out how to get
high-quality timing services inside lisp.

There is a big differnece, the code inside the body of a thread definition
is evaluated once, when the object is created. In contrast, the code inside
an algorithm is evaluated every time the algorithm is "run" via Mix etc.
I guess its a matter of taste, but I use threads whenever I have
(precomputed) data that i want to edit further (using the Map command etc.)
or when I want to define a seqential orderings of sections of a piece. In
the latter case the thread wont hold data it will hold containers of data
(which could be algos, merges, threads and whatnot.)

PostScript is a resolution-independent, vectorized graphics format
that has to be rasterized at some point in order to be rendered on 

a pixel-based display, printer page, or whatever.  Clearly, that's 

what PostScript printers are for, but some X servers do also come
with a Display PostScript extension.  The most common way to display
PostScript on a screen, however, is to use a PostScript interpreter, 

typically ghostscript/ghostview, which can then in turn be used to 

drive a non-PostScript printer.  Check out

   http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html

A Mac port of gs/gv is also available from that site.

You can use Ghostscript to look at the Postscript files (I don't think
they're Encapsulated Postscript), and BBEdit Lite or DropPS to send the
PS file directly to a Postscript printer.  Ghostscript can be found at
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html, and BBEdit Lite and DropPS
(BBEdit Lite is a text editor has DropPS built into it) can be found at
http://www.barebones.com/ and then click on the Free Stuff link.  If you
get BBEdit Lite, open the Postscript file that was created by CMN and then
under the Tools menu choose Send Postscript... Everything should be pretty
self-explanatory.  Hope this helps!

there are no books, but both sustems are well documented -- the easieest
way is to read the html docs that come with each package.

for clm, start with.

	http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/CCRMA/Software/clm/clm-manual/clm.html
in addition, most of the .ins files have useful comments. there is also a
set of tutorials by Nicky Hind, but these may be hopelessly out of data by
now.

for cm,  there are links to html tutorials and lisp example files on the
home page:

that existing clmLib should not be in the archive -- the shared library
should be compiled from scratch whenever you download clm so that it is
always in sync with the latest tarred sources. 


assuming you can open the existing clm.project (and thank you
CodeWarrior for releasing incompatible IDE'S every two weeks),i think
the fix is to add the following line to ../cmus.h


	int c_pool_active(void);


and then remake the project.  


As I mentioned in a previous email, the fix for the IDE version
incompatibility is for all.lisp to create the Codewarrior projects from
scratch when the clm system is compiled.  this is possible (it requires
some appleevent hacking) but it will take me some time to get to it,
sorry!

loading shared libraries on a mac is not straightforward, the mac has
its own notion of where yhour shared libraries should go. it looks
first in the application directory, then in the extensions folder, then
in all subdirectories of the extension folder. so for lisp to link to
clmLib (or an instrument definition), these binaries (shared libraries)
have to be in one of these locations. the easiest way to do this is to
place a link to the cw project directory (which conatinas the clmLib
you made) in the extensions folder, then you dont have to ever copy
files, or wonder which lib its actually linking to.


best,

Sometimes you need to make a new folder inside your extensions folder and
call it CLM.  Also, if you put a duplicate copy of clmLib in the CLM 
folder that's now in your extensions folder it seems to be happier than
when there is just an alias.  Make sure clmLib is called just clmLib, not
clmLib alias or clmLib copy.  Sorry for the multiple posts to the list.

Maybe once Code Warrior starts you could try going to the File menu and
manually trying to open the project.  If that doesn't work, I can send you
Code Warrior 10 CD-ROMs if you want.  (I know it works with that version.)
I know that CW Pro 1 (or whatever version it is with IDE 2.1) is unhappy,
but CW Pro 3 seems to work just fine.  Did you try using the instructions
in the second half of mac.help to build clmLib from scratch?  I found that
generally works better than trying to use the pre-built project.  If that
doesn't work, let me know and I'll give you my CW 10 CD-ROMs.

The menu "accelerators" are in snd-xmenu.c in lines like
  XtVaSetValues(mw[o_subsampling_menu],XmNmnemonic,'o',NULL);

The rest of the keyboard-related code is in snd-chn.c
(the function keyboard_command); it relies on some
X keycode translation stuff in snd-xchn.c (graph_key_press).

I'm surprised you got Lesstif to work at all!

In csh
% setenv DISPLAY somehost:0.0
% snd &

In sh:
% DISPLAY=somehost:0.0 snd &

(assuming the system has one monitor.... the first '0' after the colon
means "first monitor on this host" and the second one means "first
virtual display on that monitor" - for almost all except very fancy
multiscreen setups you just use 0.0).

I think definstrument does have to be in a file and compiled except (?) in MCL --
I forget what state this is in.

X programs do have a way to redirect output -- something like 

'display' followed by the host -- I'll look it up somewhere.
Another possibility is to run on the Sun, rlogin into the
other machine, run clm/snd there, and if all goes well, the
Snd output will automatically appear on the Sun (that's how
I run it all the time at home).

I need more info, I guess -- I just tried it on linux and sgi
and everything went smoothly.  Send me 1.eps (it's a text file).

> IV) can you recommend any books on the techniques clm uses.

I haven't read any of the books currently available; I think
we recommend Dodge and Jerse's "Computer Music" in courses
here; there's a new book just published by Eduardo Miranda
that includes CLM on an accompanying CDROM -- see info at
http://website.lineone.net/~edandalex/syntbook.htm -- I haven't
seen this book yet; the actual work in CLM was done from a huge pile
of magazine articles, scribbled notes and transparencies handed 

to me by the original developers, program code (FAIL/SAIL!) 

rescued from a dying Foonly and snarfed from several dozen ftp
sites, many questions answered by Perry Cook (he was a major
help in things like filters and physical modeling), and, gee, 

some I thought up all by myself (and never have gotten around
to writing an explanation).  The zipper instrument is my 

proudest moment. I've wanted to extend the series started by the 

FM article in CLM (fm.html), but never seem to find time.
Perhaps others on this mailing list can recommend books.

There's a discussion of this in 


Jaffe and Smith, "Extensions of the Karplus-Strong Plucked-String Algorithm"
CMJ vol 7 no 2 Summer 1983 (page 59-60), reprinted in "The Music Machine".

and if I remember right, their fix is incorporated in
pluck.ins.

The oss_sysinfo declaration is in OSS's soundcard.h;
either they've changed their header file (again!) or
there's something confused in your overall setup of
the OSS stuff.  Find the version of soundcard.h 

that the C compiler is reading (this is not always
trivial since versions can be floating all over the
place); then look for the SOUND_VERSION macro (should
be at the top of the file); then look for the oss_sysinfo
struct definition.  Somehow you've got an OSS setup
that is claiming to be "new", but doesn't define
the new structs.  If nothing is obvious, send me 

your version of soundcard.h.

I installed Codewarrior Pro 3 (I was using Pro 1 yesterday) and retried
making the project from scratch.  This time it worked perfectly.  yay!

Hi -- I think the problem may be that there is an mcl entry point defined
for it but the prototype is not exported from cmus.h. The fix is to add the
prototype and remake the clmLib project, but as you say there are problems
with this, too. From my point of view its almost impossible to keep up with
the number of (incompatible) IDE releases from  Metrowerks. the real fix is
for me to figure out the appleevent calls that will create a clm.project
from scratch everytime all.lisp is loaded. i swear this is on my "todo"
list, but then again so is tenure and at this point i couldnt honestly
predict which, if either, i might accomplish first :)

Greetings:

  Since I don't yet have a glibc system here I decided to download and
build the Snd sources myself. Unfortunately the Lesstif build breaks
with a segfault upon startup. The README indicates that a Lesstif build
was unlikely to work, and it's right about that.

  So, could we get a statically-linked libc5 version from someone
somewhere ? I do have the latest egcs, but I haven't yet installed it,
nor am I certain it will let me run a glibc-built Snd. I probably won't
have Motif here anytime soon.

  Getting there, slowly...

Hi Bil,

I tried to play 8-chan audio files with snd or clm on a SGI Octane by
the ADAT Interface and got the message

Warning: /Users/ludi/tmp/2.snd: device not available

while 4 channel soundfile work. 8 Channel Soundfiles are playable with
playaifc. Is it a problem with the installation or is there no support
in snd/clm for playing 8 channel Soundfiles?

(I hope this message doesn=B4t confuse Majordomo again)


Finally Snd is now available on the Debian GNU/Linux servers and will be =
included into the next Debian release scheduled for Dezember.
The package can already be downloaded from any Debian Mirror in the =
distribution codenamed "slink".=20
(Look <ftp://ftp.debian.org> and/or <http://www.debian.org>).

 It is propably a known problem, that keyboard shortcuts don=B4t work =
when Snd is compiled with lesstif.=20
Is this a common problem with lesstif, or just some sort of =
incompatibility between Motif and lesstif ? =20
(As I see it, keyboard shortcuts could be handled by Xt too).
Anyhow, I would appreciate it, if somebody can give me a hint there, =
otherwise I am planning to investigate upon this topic.
(which part in the source handles keyboard shortcuts ?)

I had the same probem with the soundcard.h. There seems to be a wrong =
SOUND_VERSION macro in OSS/Free, which
comes with kernels 2.0.3x. Anyway, for me it seems to be a very =
dangerous approach to rely that closely to OSS=B4s API.

PS: My solution was to just exclude the code between the checks for =
SOUND_VERSION in audio.c (was obvious)

The oss_sysinfo declaration is in OSS's soundcard.h;
either they've changed their header file (again!) or
there's something confused in your overall setup of
the OSS stuff.  Find the version of soundcard.h=20

that the C compiler is reading (this is not always
trivial since versions can be floating all over the
place); then look for the SOUND_VERSION macro (should
be at the top of the file); then look for the oss_sysinfo
struct definition.  Somehow you've got an OSS setup
that is claiming to be "new", but doesn't define
the new structs.  If nothing is obvious, send me=20

your version of soundcard.h.

I don=B4t know the code of Clisp at all, but the problem with the FFI at =

I don=B4t think that it would be a big problem making the FFI functions =

Sorry for the lack of continuity, I seem to have deleted my previous
message and Rick's replay on this subject.

Just thought I'd add something else - even if the list bug is fixed, I
think there is even a greater problem - (maybe) - there seems to be no
way, purely within Stella, do remove an object from only one of its
parent containers.

FWIW, I think that the use of multiple parents for my particular problem
is the wrong solution anyway. In the example I posted, I had a certain
thread under an "experimentation" container, then decided to use it as
part of a trial composition, and thus added it to the container that
held the mix for the composition trial.

The problem with this approach is that in all but the most trivial
cases, something would need to be changed in the container (its
amplitude, transposition, start-time, at the very least).

Hence, at least for my own specific purposes, I really need to copy the
events anyway.

Hi everybody,

I'm new to the list and to Common Music. I'm looking for a example of a
simple program that writes a MIDI file. All the example I found are made for
Stella and I work under PC/Windows, so I cannot use CM Stella commands. I
think this is done with mix-object, but I'm not to sure how to use it.

Thanks,

Stella is just a command-line driven editor.  There is just no MIDI
real-time 
output implemented under Windows.

>Stella is just a command-line driven editor.  There is just no MIDI

I know I can't do real-time midi under Windows. All I want is a LISP example
that opens a midi file for writing and writes a simple midi file to the disk
so that I can play it with an external player after. All this without using
stella commands like mix or cut and paste. I'm sure this is possible and
fairly simple.

The example I found is the UncleMilty but it uses stella commands to write
the MIDI file. Can't the MIDI be written in LISP?
Here's the example (sorry about the long example for nothing... but this is
the only one I found)
:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
;;; Uncle Milty's new piano piece...

(in-package :cm)
(in-syntax :midi)

(generator UncleMilty midi-note (length 120)
  (setf note
    (item (series 0 1 6 -5 10 11 5 16 15 21 26 20
                 forming (items p i r ri in random)
                 from (degrees c4 cs b3 fs4 fs3 in random))))
  (setf rhythm
    (item (rhythms (32 min 4) (s min 2)  (q weight 3)
                   (t8 min 3) (tq min 3) (rhythms e. s)
                   (e weight 2) in random)))
  (setf duration rhythm)
  (setf amplitude
    (item (amplitudes (ppp weight 7) (pp weight 3) p in random))))

#|

Hi,

I've made snd-2-2 rpm files for linux (i386) and mklinux (ppc);
the main changes since version 2.1 are: ports to mkLinux and
UnixWare7 (the latter thanks to Larry Plona); mklinux-snd is
the statically loaded image; the save state mechanism has been
largely completed; edit trees are editable (added Edit History
menu option); added support for the XmHTML widget and Guile 1.3;
added command/filename completion (tab in text fields); fixed
a few more linux-related audio problems; asf headers; user-definable
hooks into the lisp graphs; more lesstif-related bugfixes (there's
a PANED_WINDOWS_BUGGY switch to get the thing to work in lesstif);
sound file extension list is user-extendible; global-unset-key
and user-defined menus; a few clm/snd interface bugfixes.

Im rotating a multipage music-score to a landscape orientation.  However,
only the first page gets affected by the transform argument to the

the first pages header.

screwed up, possibly during the file transfer.  cm looks for 
"InterfaceLib" (which comes with the system) while loading shared
libraries that require it, in particular the Mi_D library.  
My guess is that maybe the mi_d lib included in the archive is
broken but Rick happens to have a good one in his extensions folder
or vice versa.  Hard to tell since i don't have access to a mac,
but a possibility if re-downloading the archive doesn't help.

implements a midi-note class that allows arbitrary cent detuning of 
individual notes.
