>X-Mailer: AOL 4.0 for Windows 95 sub 214
>
>Kevin Randle has tried for many YEARS to conjure up a "press conference" in
>General Ramey's office on July 8, 1947, and has insisted on describing
such as
>being fact in his writings regarding the Roswell Event. I have discussed this
>with him over a period of several hours on at least five occasions when he
has
>phoned me. Where is there ANY evidence of any OTHER media representatives
>being present in General Ramey's office that day? I have asked that question
>for nearly ten years and Randle has yet to provide a scintilla of EVIDENCE of
>ANY press conference. Let us examine the evidence (as opposed to rumor) and,
>hopefully, now put this fable to rest finally.
>
>First of all, "press conferences" -- as we know them today -- had not yet
been
>born! During the five years that I was a full time reporter/photographer for
>the Fort Worth Star-Telegram -- 1943-1947 -- I do not recall EVER covering
ANY
>event where there was more than ONE reporter or ONE photographer present. It
>was quite different in those days.
>
>My paper, the Morning Fort Worth Star-Telegram had no competition in its
>market so there would have been no occasion for any competition to be
present.
>There was during those years NO TV station and the radio stations did not
have
>"spot news" assignment reporters working in the field. There were no
>facilities for "remote" live broadcasts and the only portable recorders were
>poor quality wire recorders -- which I never saw used by any of the Fort
Worth
>area stations. The wire services relied on their member newspapers to provide
>both news coverage and photo coverage so I never saw anyone in the field
>specifically from a wire service. 
>
>Since just by fate I apparently arrived at Ramey's office before he did
and he
>obviously had not had an opportunity to view the Roswell debris since it all
>had not yet been unwrapped prior to my arrival (see at least two packages
>lying on the floor STILL not unwrapped in all the seven fotos taken that day)
>that certainly seems to rule out any determination to that point as to the
>true nature of the debris. Until Ramey had had an opportunity to examine the
>debris -- and then to have his "hunches" later confirmed by weather officer
>Newton -- he would not have been in any position to make any statement that
>this was NOT a "flying saucer" as had been previously announced officially
>earlier in the day by the AAF. Even generals did not claim clairvoyant powers
>in those days! If it had been determined in Roswell as to the "true identity"
>of what Marcel et al. "captured", certainly COL Blanchard as group commander
>could have made the "correction" announcement there just as he made the
>initial announcement. There would then have been NO photo opportunity in Fort
>Worth and Ramey would have had no need to get into that loop! 
>
>Ramey chose to go on the radio live to make his "weather device" announcement
>rather than to hold any kind of "press conference." He physically traveled
>across town to the studios of station WBAP (which the Star-Telegram also
>owned) about an hour after I left his offices to make the announcement around
>6 p.m. 
>
>So, as I have asked Kevin Randle since 1981, where is there ANY byline story
>of ANY reporter or ANY photo credit of ANY photographer who ever attended a
>Roswell "press conference" ANYWHERE? Or the name of ANY reporter or
>photographer who claimed to have attended such a press conference? Where are
>these phantoms?
>
>Because Kevin Randle has remained SO CONVINCED that there did exist such a
>press conference -- even in the complete absence of any scintilla of evidence
>-- I have in recent years tried to investigate this point carefully. I
went to
>the Star-Telegram morgue just last December and carefully went through all
the
>files of all the editions during early July of 1947. I now KNOW -- and have
>photo copies of -- the articles and photos the Star-Telegram published in
EACH
>edition during those days re Roswell and UFO reports. Randle never has
told me
>that he also has thoroughly researched this point. He seems to continue to
>rely on conjecture or fable. 
>
>I have read many of the Roswell accounts and I never have seen any other
photo
>of the alleged Roswell debris other than the six photos I took of General
>Ramey, COL Dubose and Major Marcel .. and the single photo of Irving Newton.
>Just recently I talked with retired Major Irving Newton and specifically
asked
>him if he recalls the circumstances of his being photographed in General
>Ramey's office. Unfortunately, he says that he has no recall as to who
>photographed him or if in fact there were any civilian reporters present in
>General Ramey's office. (There may have been some AAF PIO types there.) He
>says his best recollection is of Major Marcel following him around the office
>trying to show him the symbols on some of the pieces of wreckage and
trying to
>convince him that this stuff was from "out of this world." This is consistent
>with the sworn statement Newton made which is included in the 1995 official
>Air Force report regarding the "Roswell Incident." The interviews of Dubose
>and Marcel compelled them to rely on dimming 40+-year-old memory. There is
>evidence that they, too, may have had flawed recall also. That can be a real
>impediment to true research.
>
>I have not seen any theories advanced re who took the "mysterious" photo of
>Newton other than this probably was an AAF PIO photographer called in to take
>a picture to back up the quote from Newton validating Ramey's "weather
device"
>announcement. Incidentally, the Star-Telegram never ran the Newton photo
and I
>have never seen it published in any newspaper of that time.  
>
>Finally, if anyone knows the etiology of the Newton photo or where the
>negative might be located -- or where a good enlargement might be obtained
>that can be studied, I certainly would appreciate receiving this information.
>The RPIT (Roswell Photo Interpretation Team) very much would like to have
>access to a good copy of the Newton photo for its close and thorough
study.

>
>Consider that the very next day after I photographed General Ramey, Colonel

>Cutlines under another picture describe that the "Launching of the radar
>experimental device is about to take place in the above picture. This is

>
>Incidentally, there MUST have been SOME kind of material "switch" here

>
>There are quite detailed descriptions in the accompanying stories of the
"long

>Several things mentioned are of special interest:  
>
>The stories state that the multi-balloon "trains" aim for 30,000 to 40,000

>Colorado. They are tracked in flight by radar and by B-17s and other
aircraft.
>"We do not use the devices here for weather observation", Major Pritchard
>explained, "but for training of men and experimental purposes." Sure no
>attempts here to be very "secret." 
>
>This radar device launch demonstration for the press and the permitting of
>close-up photos was consistent with the absence of obvious security or of any
>kind of restrictions imposed on me in photographing the debris in General
>Ramey's office the day before. There, as has frequently been reported, I was
>permitted without any supervision to help unpack and "pose" for photographing
>the debris which Major Marcel had brought from Roswell to Fort Worth.
>Strangely, apparently I was the only civilian photographer ever to have an
>opportunity to photograph the strange debris. 
>
>One last observation: the Alamogordo stories include that:
>
>"These corner reflectors when packed before attaching to the towing balloons,
>are about 48 inches across and are a perfect triangle. The balloon, or
>balloons, are then attached by a string to the center of this triangle...
(the

>neoprene which is boiled an hour before use so as to increase its life and
>resistance to atmospheric conditions. The balloons are about four feet in
>diameter and light colored."
>
>Again, there was nothing meeting this description included in the smelly
>debris which I photographed in General Ramey's office. 
>
>As to the mission of these experiments, the articles stated that:
>
>"These experiments and many others will continue at the local base, the group

ET Base On Earth Sanctioned By Officials Since 1954 Confirmed;      also,
   
Secret U.S.-USSR Manned Space Station, Positioned In Orbit For Past 30
Years, 

	Disclosed.
          by
     Richard Boylan, Ph.D.

	In July of 1952 the world was electrified by large newspaper headlines and
photos of squadrons of UFOs flying repeatedly over the nation's Capital in
Washington,
DC. Four months later WW II General Dwight Eisenhower was elected President. 

     The same month President Eisenhower took office (January, 1953), the
CIA's
Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) was ordered to determine if UFOs were
interstellar vehicles. OSI convened the Robertson Panel of scientists,
which recommended that the Air Force study of UFOs, Project Blue Book, be
expanded.

     A year later, in April, 1954, as documented by Gerald Light, President
Eisenhower made a secret trip to Muroc Field (now Edwards Air Force Base),
in the California
desert, accompanied by generals, reporter Franklin Allen of the Hearst
Newspapers Group, Los
Angeles Catholic Bishop James McIntyre, and others. The President had
previously arranged to be in nearby Palm Springs, CA, purportedly for a
golfing
vacation. He "was spirited over to Muroc one night," while reporters were fed
the cover story that the President had a toothache and needed to see a
dentist.
While at Muroc Air Field, Eisenhower was present while an extraterrestrial
disc
landed. Several Star Visitors emerged to converse with the President and the
generals. The extraterrestrials requested that Eisenhower make the public
aware
of extraterrestrial contact with Earth forthwith. The President protested that
humans were not ready, and needed time to be prepared for adjusting to this
stupendous reality. 

     By the end of the following month, May, 1954, President Eisenhower's CIA
Director, Walter Bedell Smith, Prince Bernhard of Netherlands, David
Rockefeller and other top
world financiers, later-Secretary of State Dean Rusk, later-British
Minister of
Defense Denis Healey, and other Western power leaders convened the inaugural
meeting of the Bilderberg Group, "a means of Western collective management of
the world order". {Sklar, H., ed., 1981. Trilateralism. Boston: South End
Press.) One of the early items on the agenda of this world management policy
board was extraterrestrial contact. 

     The following information was disclosed to me by a confidential reliable
informant, who previously worked on contract for the National Security Agency,
and maintains connections within the Intelligence community. This information
has been confirmed by a second source, Dr. Michael Wolf of the National
Security Council's unacknowledged subcommittee, the MJ-12 Special Studies
Group. The report which follows is not "leaks". The release of this
information
is part of the Acclimation Program, an official though unacknowledged U.S.
Government policy of "processed release of information", as Dr. Wolf describes
it. (Any information presented in this report which I have developed
independent of these two governmental informants will appear in parentheses.)

     Shortly after establishing itself, the Bilderberg Group collaborated with
the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), another international policy body
devoted to world
management, concerning the problem of adjusting humankind to
extraterrestrial presence.
Bilderberg and CFR  decided jointly in the mid-1950s to enter into an
arrangement with the extraterrestrials: The ETs were given an island in French
Polynesia as a base on Earth. This arrangement afforded them an opportunity to
monitor closely Earth cultures and behavior; and it permitted Earth
governments
a way to monitor extraterrestrial culture and behavior. "It became an on-going
experiment," as my former-NSA informant put it. He adds that when official
public announcement of the extraterrestrial presence occurs, "they will be the
ones introduced to Earthlings; 'Oh, by the way, we want to welcome our
neighbors from the Pleiades, who by the way have been here since [the
beginning of Earth] time, but [are] actually living in our place, date,
space and time." The informant adds, "They are the diplomatic
corps."

        My ex-NSA informant reported that the U.S. particularly held out for
many concessions before agreeing to the arrangement. (He did not specify what
those concessions were, but history subsequent to 1954 suggests that what the
U.S. obtained was the lion's share of extraterrestrial scientist consultants,
to assist American scientists in understanding and adapting exotic ET
technologies into such devices we now know as the computer chip, fibre optics,
lasers, gene- splicing therapy, cloning, night-vision equipment,
super-tenacity
fibers (such as Kevlar lightweight armor), aerospace ceramics, Stealth
technology, particle-beam devices, and gravity-control flight.) NSC's Dr.
Michael Wolf has previously revealed in his book The Catchers of Heaven
that he
worked with ETs as part of his governmental duties. "I met with
extraterrestrial individuals every day in my work, and shared living quarters
with them," while doing research at extremely- classified underground
government research laboratories. He added, "Zetas work in underground
facilities, as requested by the U.S. Government. The ETs are not breaking the
U.S. Government- Zeta treaties, but the Government has broken treaties by
mistreating ETs, and trying to fire on UFOs." Dr. Wolf also described working
with very human-appearing races dubbed the Nordics and Semitics. He said, "The
Semitics and Nordics come from Altair 4 and 5 and from the Pleiades [star
systems]." Wolf also disclosed that in 1954 the U.S. had four extraterrestrial
corpses in the "Blue Room", Hanger 18 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio. These bodies came from a series of retrievals of downed UFOs.
"The first UFO came down in 1941 into the ocean west of San Diego, and was
retrieved by the Navy." (The Navy has held a leadership position in UFO
matters
ever since.) Between that and the first publicly-announced UFO crash in 1947,
northwest of Roswell, New Mexico, Wolf says there was another crash in
1946, as
well as two other crashes in 1947 besides Roswell.

   Secret U.S.-USSR Manned Space Station, Positioned In Orbit For Past 30
Years, Disclosed.

        In a report earlier this year, I wrote that in 1969, Apollo 10
astronauts Stafford, Cernan and Young were the first to approach an
extraterrestrial beacon (dubbed The Monolith) and film it. Now, with
additional
information, I can add that they were not, however, the first astronauts to
spot this ET beacon. That Monolith was first sighted by Russian cosmonaut Yuri
Gagarin, the first man in space, in 1961. He was followed that same year by
American astronaut Alan Shephard, who also sighted the beacon. It turns out
that sighting the beacon was not that unlikely. My NSA informant says, "There
are billions of them floating all over." Dr. Michael Wolf shed additional
light
on the beacons. "They are 'postcards from the rim'. They emit both light and
tone signals, sending a mathematical language. There may be five or more ET
civilizations involved in setting up these beacons." 

        Ignore those Boeing commercials and the NASA press releases about how
America "soon" will have its own first manned space station. My ex-NSA
informant revealed that there has been a manned "deep space platform" in orbit
above Earth for over thirty years! "It [has] had three-manned [American] crews
as well as Russians 'on' since '68!" He further states that since 1973, the
space station received additional extremely-high technology, "and has had
upgrades since." His disclosures confirms reports I had heard previously from
former military officers about a secret space platform in orbit. 

        This disclosure makes clear, as does my earlier report about a secret
military astronaut program retrieving the "Apollo 10" Monolith in 1972 for
study, that the Cape Canaveral Space Shuttles launches and the "first
American"
space station on NASA's drawing boards are just government "cover" programs.
Such programs have served to deflect the public from becoming aware before now
of the existence of a black-project military space station and classified
military craft which can go well past orbit into deep space. 

        There will be additional disclosures, which will be brought to you as
they become available.

Sept 4, 1998, 7:30 pm: Newly assembled research team consisting of Al
Dunaway, team leader, Jan Brook, recorder, and two new individuals set up
in an open field in a semi-secluded area of Broken Arrow,OK. The temp. is
107 degrees.
        The four of us take positions at the four cardinal compass
directions. Al begins the evening with a short orientation lecture and
identification of possible light interference. These don't appear to be a
major problem as they are shielded by a stand of very tall trees. The main
flight path to Tulsa International Airpark is north and west of us, and
should be no problem. The sky overhead is perfectly clear.
        Moonrise at 7:52 pm is very full and bright. This will cut down on
visibility of starlight. We begin meditation and CTS.
        Between 8:15 and 8:20 pm a streak of sparkling white lights in the
sky about 60 degrees azimuth to the northeast are spotted by both Al and
Jan. Five minutes later a blue light streaks from west to east slightly
north, just below Orion's belt. All four of us notice a peculiar odor of
fresh mushrooms in the field. The temperature has dropped to a mild 78
degrees.
        At 8:55 pm, a slow moving satellite crosses from NW to SE directly
overhead. This is itentified as Cosmos 192. Then at 9:00 pm, at 45 degrees
azimuth almost due NE, a stationary object draws the group's attention by
flashing brightly once.
        Al signals twice with the spotlight and the object moves to the
east and dims out. A moment or two later, the object shoots downward toward
the east at a 45 degree angle, leaving a 6" streak of light at arm's
length. This streak looks like a bright shooting star [Note: a relative of
Jan's stated later that he and his wife saw the same "shooting star" and
commented on how odd it looked]
        9:20 pm - slightly north of zenith, Jan witnesses what appears to
be a "V" or boomarang shaped cluster of fuzzy white objects shoot quickly
and silently to the west, visible for only a second or two.
        9:45 pm - Another single flash to the north.
        9:55 pm - Another slow mover traveling south to north is spotted at
80 degrees azimuth. When we signal to it, it goes dim but no further
indication that it is anything but a satellite. However, this is not a
common direction for it to be traveling.
        10 pm - a single flash, due east at 45 degrees. Shortly after, a
727 size jet with landing lights and wheels down passes right overhead
toward the southeast.
        11 pm - The group ends the evening with meditation and sending
light energy and greetings into the Universal Consciousness. We make plans
to meet again on the following Friday.

OPERATIONAL READINESS AND THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING            
OBJECT/EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE (UFO/ETI) SUBJECT:
WHY MILITARY AND NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERS HAVE A NEED TO KNOW

        22 August 1998
        copyright 1998
        Steven M. Greer M.D., Director of CSETI



Abstract:

Key military and national security leaders have been inadequately informed
on the UFO/ETI subject due to its management under Unacknowledged Special
Access Projects (USAPS).  This lack of information has resulted in
substantial national security risks.  The risk of inadequate and/or
dangerous actions by uninformed or misinformed leaders is greatly increased
by the lack of in-depth briefings and discussions on this subject.  Key
areas of operational readiness are thus placed "at risk" by these leaders
being dangerously uninformed or misinformed on such matters as the
following:

- Use of Alien Reproduction Vehicles (ARVs) in false indications and
warnings (I &W) scenarios.
- The unexpected appearance and disappearance of extraterrestrial vehicles
with super-luminal speed (faster than light) capabilities.
-Unanticipated extraterrestrial concern over deployment of space-based
military and other assets.

Senior military leaders and senior national security leaders, including the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council, Senior Watch Officers
in the National Military Command Center,  key Congressional leaders , the
President, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence,
among others, clearly have a need-to-know regarding the issues above.


Background and Introduction:

Since 1990, CSETI (The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial
Intelligence) a non-profit research organization based in the United
States, has been conducting original research into the subject of UFOs and
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI). In 1991, an initial Comprehensive
Assessment was completed and since that time CSETI has been investigating
the subject through real-time field expeditions throughout the world and
through the identification of scientific evidence and information sources
with direct knowledge of the subject. Sources for our information and
subsequent assessments include:
        
        >Direct, real-time observation of UFOs/Extraterrestrial Objects via
field research teams deployed throughout the world


        >Collection of retrospective evidence with thousands of case
reports, including military and civilian pilot encounters, military and
civilian radar contact with these objects, landing trace cases,
photographic and videotape evidence and thousands of pages of declassified
government documents. 

        >Extensive interviews with several dozen scientists, military and
civilian witnesses in intelligence and other programs and civilian research
witnesses who have been involved in covert programs.  These witnesses have
had direct, personal knowledge of UFO/ETI events and covert programs, 
including the retrieval and reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial
spacecraft and the covert applications of  technological breakthroughs
resulting from possession of these spacecraft.


The above sources and research have resulted in a number of assessments
regarding the subject in general and national security implications in
particular. These are provided as separate attachments to this document..


Overview of UFO-Related USAPs:

While tight compartmentation of intelligence and programs is often needed
to maintain security of sensitive operations, excessive classification and
compartmentation  poses a threat to national security and military
readiness and is contrary to Presidential directives.  In the case of the
UFO/ETI subject, extreme secrecy and multiple levels of special 
compartmentation has existed since the 1940s .  This extreme secrecy,
together with the special nature of the technologies involved, has resulted
in a potentially dangerous situation with respect to lack of oversight of
actions not in the national interest, significant degradation in military
readiness to deal with events related to ETI/UFO and total lack of
Congressional oversight.  

The nature of the covert entity/USAP which currently manages the UFO matter
is described in the attached paper ‘Unacknowledged' . Briefly, this unusual
USAP has the following characteristics:

        > Global in scope
        > Multiple levels of sub-compartmentalization
        > Primarily based in the civilian, privatized
	contracting/work-for-others sectors
        > Runs parallel to and generally  separate from conventional
	government, military and intelligence programs, including other
	sensitive USAPs/black projects
        > Exists as a hybrid entity which draws from high technology
	corporations and compartmented, government, intelligence and military
operations, but which in effect functions as an independent, separate entity
        > Apparently, is controlled by no single branch of conventional
	government, military Service or agency  
        > In general, access to this project is by project-controlled
	inclusion and access has little to do with the individual's position
	in government, military rank or position in the traditional    
	(constitutional) chain of command
        >After nearly 60 years of studying advanced extraterrestrial
	technologies from retrieved ET devices, the group which controls this USAP
	possesses substantial technologies which may present a threat to conventional
	military assets and to world security in general.
        > Funding for these operations is derived both from the so-called
	‘black budget' and from ‘creative', non-governmental sources.
        > Maintenance of secrecy/control over this project has been at all
	costs and has consistently violated legal, constitutional oversight and
	checks and balances and the rights of U.S. citizens.

Discussions with a sitting Director of Central Intelligence, senior White
House staff, senior members of Congress serving on key, relevant
committees, senior military staff in the US and UK, among others, has shown
that access to projects related to UFOs / ETI is not related to position or
constitutional law. Five star Admiral and former UK Minister of Defense, 
Lord Hill-Norton has confirmed that a similar arrangement exists in the
United Kingdom. Directed inquiry by such officials has not resulted in
disclosure, even when the request  originated from the office of the
President of the United States.

Why Key Military and National Security Leadership Need to Know :

There are several inter-related aspects of the UFO/ETI issue which
necessitate key military, intelligence and national security leaders
knowing about this matter. Failure by such leaders to be adequately
informed has resulted in a situation wherein important decisions and
actions may be made which could result in extremely undesirable outcomes.
The capabilities of the UFO/ETI USAP allow for widespread deception of
chain-of-command leadership and for surprise scenarios which could be
catastrophically misinterpreted.

Moreover, while there is no objective evidence that the non-human life
forms behind the genuine extraterrestrial events are at all hostile towards
the earth or humanity in general, events could be - and more importantly we
understand have been - negatively  misinterpreted, leading to unwarranted
human military actions against such ET assets. Such actions constitute a
genuine world security threat about which conventional military and
civilian leadership is unaware. In order to avoid the potential for future
human military actions which could lead to a dangerous escalation of
events, it is imperative that military and national security leadership be
adequately informed on this subject.

Below is a brief summary of scenarios and activities which illustrate why
such leaders have an immediate need to know on this matter:

        > Misidentification of UFO/Extraterrestrial assets.  Since there
are both genuine extraterrestrial and look-alike human engineered ARV
(Alien Reproduction Vehicle) assets, the risk for confusion and
misidentification is real.  Such confusion could result in actions which
could then lead to unintended results. (See also False Indications and
Warnings below.)

        >Surprise by extraterrestrial object.  In the past, senior military
commanders have been surprised by the sudden appearance of extraterrestrial
objects and have taken hostile actions towards them. For example, in
October of 1981, such an object appeared off of the eastern seaboard,
triggering pandemonium in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) Command
Center.  This object, estimated 300 feet in diameter and disc shaped, was
able to rapidly move, in one radar sweep from an area off the coast of
Newfoundland to off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia.  During this daylight
event, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Command Center went to Condition Zebra alert
("Stripes") and orders were given by NORAD to the CINC, ADM Harry Train, to
identify this object and even force it down if necessary.  Fighters were
scrambled from land and sea-based forces and , while one fighter got close
enough to clearly photograph the object, it moved in the span of one radar
sweep  from off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia to an area in the Atlantic
Ocean near the Canary Islands, turned upward at a 60 degree angle, and left
the earth's atmosphere.  This situation, which resulted in surprise to the
CINC, chaos on the Command Center Floor, and orders to force down the
object (which could have had catastrophic consequences) could have been
avoided with concept and scenario briefings to top military leaders and the
development of  clear "Special Rules of Engagement" (ROEs) for these unique
situations.

        >Misinterpretation of Extraterrestrial Actions.  It is our
assessment that more that one extraterrestrial civilization is involved in 
reconnaissance of the earth and in surveillance of  global military
developments. In the past, extraterrestrial concern over weapons of mass
destruction has led to technological demonstrations at certain strategic
sites, such as SAC ICBM facilities at Minot ND in November of 1975, which
had its strategic launch capabilities inerted . Similar neutralization, we
understand, occurred in the USSR. While such an event would understandably 
generate human military concern, it is important for such events to be
interpreted in a broader context which is non-anthropocentric. While one
view may hold that this action demonstrated extraterrestrial hostility , it
is more likely that, given the event's non-violent nature, that it was
intended to be a message of great concern over such globally destructive
weapon systems. Unless leadership is adequately briefed on this subject,
the potential for a catastrophic misinterpretation of extraterrestrial
actions and intentions exists. 

        >Extraterrestrial concern over space-based military assets. It is
our understanding that the extraterrestrial view of human military assets
being placed in space is very unfavorable and that in the recent past
certain events have taken place which underscore this ET viewpoint. U.S.
Space Command and other military entities dealing with space or which
interface with and depend upon space-based assets  need to be aware of this
concern.  It appears that ET concern is based on the increasing
militarization of space, combined with a continued high level of human
warfare and violence and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
There is also reason to believe that covert USAP programs are targeting ET
assets with increasing frequency and efficacy (see below).

        >Multiple credible first-hand military and intelligence program
witnesses have described covert USAP utilization of advanced weapons
systems to track, target and destroy extraterrestrial spacecraft. Such
events have apparently increased in frequency and accuracy since the 1980s.
If true, this constitutes a grave national and world security crisis about
which key leaders have an urgent need to know. In light of the testimony
which we have heard, simple denials that such events are not occurring or
are somehow justified are  not sufficient grounds to dismiss these reports
or take a hands-off approach. Key military and national security leaders
need to fully investigate this matter and produce a full assessment of the
situation for the National Command Authorities (NCA), the Chairman, Joints
Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), and key congressional leadership.

        >Multiple, military and civilian witnesses involved in covert
programs dealing with this subject and having first-hand personal knowledge
 have corroborated reports of UFO/ETI related USAPS' intent to utilize
reverse-engineered ET based technologies to stage (hoax) ET events of a
violent nature.  The existence of a very powerful covert USAP which
possesses extraordinarily advanced technologies capable of
materialization/dematerialization, faster-than-light travel, antigravity
propulsion and related systems is in itself a direct threat to conventional
and constitutional military and national security leadership and control.
Such an entity, unless fully under direct, legal and constitutional chain
of command oversight, and control,  has great potential for abuse,
deception and manipulation of traditional governmental leadership. For
example, an important intelligence witness has described the planned use of
ARVs in a false indications and warnings scenario in which the ARVs would
attack conventional military assets to make it appear that we were being
attacked by hostile extraterrestrial life forms. If military and national
security leaders do not know of such covert human capabilities, they could
be deceived by such a scenario and could then issue orders for unwarranted
and potentially catastrophic counter-measures against genuine ET assets.

        >Sub-electromagnetic, non-linear communications systems of
extraterrestrial origin which interface directly with consciousness and
thought have been reverse-engineered by covert USAPs and can be used
against civilian and military leadership in False I and W scenarios.
Information directly from a foreign head of state suggests that this has
already occurred. Such non-linear telemetry systems, which bypass linear
time/space and interface directly with mind and thought can be modified to
induce hoaxed but very real experiences in target subjects. Senior military
and civilian national security leaders need to know about the potential of
these systems, thus minimizing the deceptive value of such systems should
they be directed against them. (Alleged ‘Alien Abduction' experiences are
largely the result of the misuse of these systems by covert USAPs.)

        >NASA, civilian astronomers and other scientists are increasingly
concerned about the possibility of an earth orbit-crossing asteroid or
comet impacting the earth. Teams at JPL and elsewhere have already detected
thousands of such earth orbit-crossing objects within our solar system. 
Large impacts in the past have created what is now the Gulf of Mexico,
Hudson Bay and other geological features on the surface of the earth.  Most
scientists agree that it is not a question of ‘if, but ‘when', such an
impact will take place. Conventional scientists have discussed using
nuclear weapons and other conventional means to avert such an impact.
However, it is clear that UFO related USAPS possess technologies which are
far more advanced and which could be brought to bear on this problem. This
is especially true of gravity-altering technologies which could be used to
change the mass effect of such an object and move it off of an earth
intersecting course. Since such an impact could potentially terminate human
civilization as we know it, senior military and civilian national security
leaders should have knowledge of and access to such UFO USAP related
technologies.  Moreover, use of such technologies in space for such a
critical and beneficial purpose  may be dependent on the perception by ET s
that such space deployment would be only for peaceful purposes. We
understand that this is not the current perception.

Conclusions:

        >Disclosure of the reality of the UFO/ETI subject and associated
technologies would certainly alter many aspects of life on earth, including
geopolitical relations, technology, economics and the general social order.
Military and national security leaders unaware of the subject cannot
adequately anticipate the far-reaching implications of such a disclosure
and would therefore be unprepared. Since CSETI and others are actively
pursuing  such a disclosure in the relatively near future, it is important
that leaders understand these implications fully and are able to respond to
the challenges of such a disclosure in an orderly manner. Should a sudden,
undeniable extraterrestrial event occur, it is even more important that
military and national security leaders be informed and are prepared to
respond properly to the situation. 

        >The energy and propulsion technologies associated with
extraterrestrial spacecraft utilize the zero - point field of energy, do
not rely on nuclear or internal combustion engines and are therefore
non-polluting. One of the great ‘wild cards' facing the military and
national and world security leaders is the eventual exhaustion of fossil
fuels and the concomitant decay in the earth's ecosystem.  With the rapid
industrialization of China, India and much of the third world, the damage
to the earth's ecosystem will only accelerate exponentially, even as the
fuel sources are more rapidly diminished.  Currently, we exist as a
terminal technological civilization - a serious long term security issue
indeed. However, the covert USAP responsible for UFO/ETI matters has
already reversed-engineered energy and propulsion systems which render the
internal combustion engine obsolete. We estimate that this breakthrough
occurred between 1954 and 1957. Ben Rich of Lockheed Skunkworks, prior to
his death,  confirmed to a CSETI consultant that "we already have the means
to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black
projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit
humanity...".   Long term national security planning necessitates the
eventual (and preferably near-term) release of these technologies for the
benefit of mankind and the preservation of the planet. Certainly national
security and military leaders should understand these technologies, which
will replace the entire global energy and internal combustion
infrastructure. Moreover, they should anticipate the implications related
to the release of such technologies so that the transition to sustainable
energy systems can be as smooth and peaceful as possible.

These are a few of the national security and military implications of the
UFO/ETI subject - any one of which justifies a full briefing to leadership
on the subject.

Recommendations:

We recommend senior military and national security leaders take the
following actions:

        >Receive a thorough briefing on the subject by CSETI leadership and
military/civilian witnesses
        
        >Fully brief CINCS, and develop special ROEs for ETI/UFO
encounters.

        >Independently investigate the subject and penetrate USAP
operations related to the subject

        >Become fully involved in covert projects related to the subject to
ensure that such projects are adequately supervised and are under
the direct and continuous control of the constitutional chain of
command

        >Correct and/or restrain any USAPS's covert misuse of advanced
technologies or weapon systems related to UFOs .

        >Attempt peaceful, cooperative engagement of these life forms and
assiduously avoid violent military engagement. CSETI has a prototype
project which was been peacefully engaging ETI for over 7 years
and suggests that national and international leaders adopt a similar
approach


        >Carefully consider the deployment of space-based military assets
in light of the above information and avoid actions which may be viewed
as bellicose or hostile by extraterrestrial life forms.

Subject: Alarming Effects Of Genetic Plant Manipulation

Alarming Effects Of Genetic Plant Manipulation Discovered By Jeff Barnard
9-2-98


(AP) - Heightening environmentalists' fears about the dangers of genetic
engineering, a weed that was altered by scientists to resist a herbicide
also developed far greater ability to pollinate other plants and pass its
traits on.

The findings raise the possibility of the emergence of "superweeds''
impervious to weedkillers.

The weed's enhanced ability to pollinate other plants was an unintended
consequence of experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana, a species commonly
used in genetic research.

Joy Bergelson, a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of
Chicago, said the findings show that genetic engineering can substantially
increase the chances of "transgene escape,'' or the spread of certain
traits from one plant to another.

Her study was published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.

Charles Margulis of Greenpeace said the results confirm fears that
genetically engineering cotton and soybeans to survive spraying with
herbicides to make weed-control easier will force farmers to spray heavier
doses of herbicides or use types that are less environmentally safe.

"It's just another chink in the armor of the industry, which keeps saying
environmentalists' claims of health concerns just aren't justified,''
Margulis said.

Scientists have already recognized that when a genetically engineered crop
grows near a weed relative, the gene-engineered trait will eventually
transfer to the weed.

In a separate study, Ohio State University scientist Allison Snow found
that when weeds acquire herbicide resistance from genetically engineered
crops, they maintain their ability to pass these traits on, rather than
becoming less fertile, as some had believed.

Ms. Bergelson compared the fertilization rate of plants that were mutated
to make them resistant to the herbicide chlorsulphuron, and plants that
were genetically altered for the same trait.

The genetically altered plants were able to fertilize other plants at a
rate 20 times greater than that of the mutants.

Why this was so is not clear. Ms. Bergelson speculated that the pollen from
the genetically altered plants might have a longer lifespan than normal
pollen or have some other competitive advantage.

Ms. Bergelson's findings do not raise any fundamental new issues for
companies developing genetically engineered plants, said Rob Horsch, vice
president and general manager of the Agracetus Campus of Monsanto Co. in
Middleton, Wis. The government already has stringent controls.

"The possibility of outcrossing has always and will always exist, and none
of the regulatory decisions or safety analyses that I'm familiar with
depend on arguments about the frequency of cross-pollination itself,''
Horsch said.

Monsanto Sows Seeds Of Discontent In Canada, India

Multinational chemical giant Monsanto Co. is raising ire internationally with
its various campaigns to make genetically modified foods and seeds the next
big thing in agriculture, despite environmental concerns about the
ramifications of such poorly understood tampering.

In Canada, environmentalists are wary of Monsanto's plan to "give Mother
Nature a helping hand" by producing pesticide- and herbicide-resistant corn
and other crops. Critics warn that not enough is known about the side effects
of fooling with the natural engineering of crops, and are concerned that most
people eating these foods are unaware of the crops' origins, since
genetically
altered seeds are not subject to mandatory labeling.

Monsanto, apparently aware of such criticisms, has launched an extensive
"greenwashing" campaign, including a recent brochure, printed on recycled
paper with the motto "Food, Health, Hope," claiming that the new genetically
altered foods help promote sustainable development. "By working now to put
the
technology and the infrastructure required to meet future foods needs, we can
feed the world for centuries to come and improve the quality of life for
people worldwide," the brochure states.

But groups like Oxfam charge that pharmaceutical companies are merely
developing a market for their chemicals, and that herbicide-resistant seeds
could make individuals resistant to antibiotics.

Concerns are growing in Canada, where in Ontario, for example, 15 percent of
all corn production is now genetically altered. Monsanto's altered corn and
potatoes, which have been available in Canada since 1996, work by adding an
extra gene to seeds to produce insect-protected crops. Canadian farmers also
use herbicide-resistant corn, soybean and canola seeds, which allow a
plant to
flourish in the face of chemicals that kill surrounding weeds.

Monsanto's own "Roundup corn," designed to tolerate the company's Roundup
herbicide could be the next genetically modified product to hit the Canadian
market. If this corn is developed, farmers will be required, by contract, to
use only Monsanto's Roundup herbicide. The product already has obtained
one of
the two necessary safety approvals from Canadian officials, and is under
review for the second.

In India, another pending Monsanto product -- the so-called "terminator gene"
-- has raised fears, although the company insists that it does not exist. .
.yet.

The terminator gene is said to make grains sterile rendering them unfit for
use as seed. The result would be that farmers could not reuse the produce as
seed and would have to buy them from the producing company every season. 

Agricultural scientists worry that if the gene found its way into non-target
crops that results could be catastrophic, and have expressed misgivings about
foreign multinationals using advanced technology to corner India's massive
seed market. Environmentalists also have raised concerns about the protection
of biodiversity.

The controversy arose after the USDA and the Delta and Pine Land company, one
of Monsanto's seed company partners, applied for a "prophetic patent" for the
terminator gene. Monsanto claims that plans for the the gene are still in a
conceptual phase and that it does not yet exist. The idea, according to
company spokespersons, was to develop a process that would provide gene
protection to plants such as tobacco.

Just posted to the Website.

1971 Summer - Elk Mountain, Wyoming

Here are stories that have not had the media publicity or attention that
the Roswell incident got, but should. This first one I personally dug up,
which was on my TVshow originally and now here it is finally in print.

Summer of 1971 Elk Mountain,Wyoming, Joe and his family are camping and
they see a orange-ish blue light streak across the evening sky, it crossed
the horizon in a matter of seconds. They all witnesses it impact into Elk
Mountain and blow up a cloud a debris up into the air.

Within about 10 minutes it started smoking and they could see it had
started a fire. His father having heavy equipment and being in the logging
trade immediately got the family home and took his equipment to the area.
The fire moved quickly nearly killing Joe's father, destroying his
bulldozer that he burrowed under in the nick of time, this fire storm took
two weeks to contain.

By the next morning the military had shown up and blocked highway 130 in
the nearby town of Saratoga and quarantined the town allowing nobody to
come or go.

Within a few hours the telephones, televisions, radios and 2way CB's were
dead throughout the town, snow and static is all they could get.

The next day swarms of NASA vehicles started showing up in cars, trucks,
even limousines with NASA insignias. The town had been chaos for two weeks
but this one day was particularly chaotic. Joe noticed a crowd of people
gathering at the corner.

Curious, he went over to see two big trucks with flat bed trailers side by
side. It had this huge oblong egg shaped lump on it under tarps and nets,
it was so big and heavy it caused the trailer to scrape the ground.

They even had to lift the power lines for it on their way through town.

They got no mail until the ordeal was over and it had been opened. During
the ordeal there was no communication going in or out of the town, no
newspapers, no nothing. After the ordeal the newspapers only reported the
incident as a fire nothing else.

Health and Medical Issues in the News 

Zapped by Science, Again 
   
“There is little study looking at how our states of awareness and imagery
might be affected by the electro-
magnetic corridors we inhabit.”
— Michael Persinger,
neuroscientist


For Michael Persinger's EMF experiments, volunteers are strapped into an
armchair, don a modified motorcycle helmet and weather a series of zaps.
(ABCNEWS.com)  


Special to ABCNEWS.com
In a basement at a university in a small Canadian city sits a chamber
resembling a cramped bank vault. The experiments performed there may
challenge the scope of the raging debate over whether electromagnetic
fields from power lines, home wiring and appliances can cause health
problems. 
     Volunteers sit in the chamber’s cushy armchair and don a snug-fitting
modified motorcycle helmet — studded on both sides with coiled wire
cylinders. They wait to be zapped with magnetic fields sent to the brain
via computer. 
    Neuroscientist Michael Persinger, the chamber’s mastermind, knows from
extensive published data that he can control some of the imagery his
subjects experience by manipulating complex electromagnetic patterns and
their delivery to sites in the brain. 

Mind Games 
Persinger has demonstrated under controlled conditions that he can induce
perceptions of mystical and paranormal events, including visitations by
gods, demons or other apparitions, and, yes, indeed, of being abducted by
alien creatures. 
     Persinger’s research at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario,
reveals that the brain can discriminate and respond to even weak external
magnetic fields, particularly when the fields affect the temporal lobes. 
     “The brain is highly sensitive to information,” says Persinger, “and
when magnetic fields are complex or irregularly pulsed, these fields can
begin communicating with the brain, altering its information flow and the
way the individual perceives himself and the environment.” 
     Studies elsewhere have shown that regions deep within the temporal
lobes, such as the amygdala and hippocampus, are strongly associated with
the regulation of emotions and are highly unstable electrically. Stimulate
those areas during surgery, for example, and people typically report
perceptions of strange beings and mystical encounters. 

Pathological Fixation 
But in the studies of electromagnetic fields, Persinger says, “Science has
unfortunately almost entirely neglected their impact on consciousness and
behavior. There is very little study today looking at how our day-to-day
states of awareness and imagery might be affected by the increasingly
complex electromagnetic corridors we inhabit.” 
     His criticism is well-founded. The latest official scientific
pronouncement on the health effects of EMFs, released in July by the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the Energy
Department, pays scant attention to consciousness and behavior. 
    The main focus of debate on EMFs has always been on leukemia and
cancer. This latest assessment includes the “possibility” that magnetic
fields generated by power lines can cause leukemia in children, and that
on-the-job exposure can cause leukemia in adults. Among other conclusions,
the report cites weak evidence that EMFs can cause sleep disturbances and
inhibit a drug’s function in the body. 

Stop, You’re Scaring Me 
No doubt we’re in store for another round of scientific and political
controversy over EMFs. Some pundits have even called for an end to research
on the subject, declaring that science has more or less shown there isn't
much to the issue. Let’s not keep frightening the public, they plead. 
     Persinger suggests that such shortsighted debate will continue until
hell freezes over unless researchers pay more attention to the patterns
underlying electromagnetic signals, as he has done in investigating their
effects on the brain. 
     “There has been an obsession, based on current funding, with studying
very symmetrical and simplistic electromagnetic signals,” he says.
Approaching it that way, he adds, “We’re going to miss out on a lot of
information.” 
     So is living in the midst of an electromagnetic smog something like
hanging out in Persinger’s chamber? Is our day-to-day existence modulated
by pulses coming at us from this smog? 
     His research suggests that it’s possible that our consciousness and
behavior are affected by certain electromagnetic signals. Tests at
Laurentian also indicate that some individuals might be more vulnerable to
these hits because their temporal lobes are more electrically unstable. 

Visions and Revisions 
But why do so many subjects in the chamber experience strange, even bizarre
imagery? Persinger calls attention to the instability of the temporal lobes
and how everyone to some degree has brief electrical outbursts, or
microseizures, in those regions. 
     He theorizes that when this occurs, information from the brain’s right
hemisphere, more dominant in spatial, nonverbal tasks, intrudes into the
left hemisphere, noted for its role in language and in providing us with a
sense of self. For a moment, at least, an altered state of awareness can
emerge, including visual and spatial distortions. 
     Do visions of demons, gods, UFOs and religious revelations occur when
these electrical brainstorms are coupled with our emotions and cultural
expectations? Are these events enhanced by complex electromagnetic signals,
and can we expect more of the same as the EMF fog thickens? 
     Well, Persinger says yes, but obviously more research is in order. 
     It always makes me smile when people think science has settled an
issue. And, oh, by the way, I’ve had the experience of getting zapped in
Persinger’s chamber. Suffice to say that I’ll probably never walk under or
near a power line again without recalling that amazing 20-minute session. 

 Nicholas Regush produces medical features for ABCNEWS. In the weeks ahead,
he’ll take an inside look at other trouble spots in medicine, herald some
innovative achievements and analyze medical trends that will likely have
great impacts on our lives. 

___________________________________

This article is extremely important, as it shows how easily hoaxed UFO/ET
experiences can be induced electromagnetically.  Persinger has been
appearing on several TV shows such as TLC recently to demonstrate this.

Interesting also that this is being done in Canada, where much of the
MK-Ultra Mind Control research took (takes!) place.

Guardian (london)                             By George Monbiot

                          Thursday August 13, 1998
                                      
   Three weeks ago, something happened in Canada. It could not have been
    very important because hardly anyone on this side of the Atlantic is
                       even aware that it took place.
                                      
   A total of four column inches in the British newspapers was devoted to
   the event. The handful of people who bothered to read them would have
   learnt that a company no one has heard of, which makes a product whose
      name no one can pronounce, received some money from the Canadian
   government and an assurance that it could continue making the product.
                                      
      It is the butterfly's wing over North America that will cause a
                            hurricane in Europe.
                                      
     The company is called the Ethyl Corporation, and its product is a
   chemical called methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, or - and
                    let us thank God for acronyms - MMT.
                                      
    MMT is a fuel additive which is mixed with petrol to prevent engine
    knocking. Many scientists believe it is also a dangerous neurotoxin.
     Manganese entering the body through the lungs causes nerve damage
         which can lead to psychosis, memory loss and early death.
                                      
   Until last year, Canada was the only country on earth in which MMT was
    sold. It is legal to sell it in most of the US - but surveys suggest
     that suppliers will not stock it, not least because it appears to
        damage car engines, causing the release of other pollutants.
                                      
    Canadian MPs questioned why their citizens should be exposed to this
        peculiarly unpleasant species of pollution. After a long and
   intelligent debate, the parliament voted to ban it in April 1997. Had
   the vote taken place three years earlier, the Ethyl Corporation would
   have had to abide by the decision. A sovereign parliament had decided
     to protect its citizens from a deadly poison, and that, you would
              imagine, would have been the end of the matter.
                                      
      But, since 1994, corporations in Canada, the US and Mexico have
     enjoyed a new and astonishing power over elected authorities. The
   North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) entitles companies to sue
      governments they believe to be raising unfair barriers to trade.
                                      
     Ethyl sued the Canadian government for the "expropriation" of its
    "property" (namely its anticipated profits) and the "damage" to its
   "good reputation" caused by the parliamentary debate. It took its suit
    to Nafta, where a secret tribunal - whose records are not disclosed
     and whose decisions cannot be appealed - began to assess the case.
     Last month, the Canadian government, realising that its chances of
            success were approximately zero, settled with Ethyl.
                                      
    It agreed to allow the corporation to resume sales of MMT in Canada.
   It agreed to pay Ethyl $13 million in compensation. It agreed, too, to
    mislead its citizens. Upon settling, it announced that "MMT poses no
                               health risk".
                                      
      So what has any of this got to do with us? Well, the Nafta rules
     allowing the Ethyl Corporation to sue the Canadian government are
    almost identical to the provisions of the Multilateral Agreement on
      Investment which, if passed, will allow corporations to sue the
   governments, such as Britain's, which sign it. This is not surprising,
      because the MAI was modelled on Nafta, to "harmonise" investment
           standards in the rest of the world with North America.
                                      
   For the past year and a half, British ministers have been assuring us
    that the MAI does "not affect the rights of signatories to carry out
       normal regulation", that it will "weaken neither environmental
   regulation nor worker protection" and that it contains "nothing . . .
    that gives investors the right to be compensated for lost profits".
   Far from undermining domestic legislation, it simply establishes that
    foreign investors should be treated no less favourably than domestic
                                 investors.
                                      
     Yet MMT was banned in Canada irrespective of who produced it: the
     rules were precisely the same for foreign and domestic investors.
    This, as campaigners predicted, offered no protection at all to the
                  sovereignty of the Canadian parliament.
                                      
      In March this year, a ragged band of voluntary bodies and direct
    activists won an extraordinary victory against the MAI. By exposing
        the monumental threat to democracy it posed, they forced the
   governments engaged in secret negotiations to postpone the agreement.
                                      
     Now Britain and the other negotiators are trying again. Again they
     will tell us that it presents no threat to the democratic process.
    Again they will tell us that it will not undermine the protection of
    workers, consumers or the environment. And again they will be wrong.

1) I heard fluoride is a poison. Is this true?

Yes. Fluoride is an acute toxin with a rating higher than that of lead.

According to "Clinical Toxicology of Commercial products," 5th Edition,
1984, lead is given a toxicity rating of 3 to 4, and Fluoride is rated at 4
(3 = moderately toxic, 4 = very toxic). On December 7, 1992, the new EPA
Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for lead was set at 0.015 ppm, with a goal
of 0.0ppm. The MCL for fluoride is currently set for 4.0 ppm - that's over
250 times the permissable level of lead.

Fluoride used in water fluoridation is also a toxic waste product -- which
means it contains other heavy metals. It is the most bone seeking element
known to mankind. The US Public Health Service has stated that fluoride
makes the bones more brittle and dental enamel more porous.

2) How much fluoride am I taking in?

Current total intake is now estimated to be between 5 and 7 mg/day in
"optimally fluoridated" areas. Current fluoride intake is equally divided
between drinking water (in fluoridated areas), food, other beverages, and
dental products, meaning that even if you don't live in a fluoridated area,
fluoride is endangering your health. Average fluoride content in juices is
0.02 to 2.80 parts per million, in part because of variations in fluoride
concentrations of water used in production. Children's ingestion of
fluoride from juices and juice-flavored beverages can be substantial and a
crucial factor in developing fluorosis. Grape juice has been found to
contain up to 6.8 mg/L of fluoride, a can of chicken soup up to 4 mg of
fluoride. Fluoride can be found in water, toothpaste, mouthwash, Dentist's
treatment, fluoride pills, juice, soft drinks, canned food, commercial
fruit and vegetables, Teflon and Tefal coated items (such as frying pans),
etc. (Note: No "optimal" fluoride intake has ever been scientifically
documented.)

3) How much is too much?

As little as 0.04 mg/kg of body weight per day has been proven to cause
adverse health effects. Retention of 2 mg a day will produce crippling
skeletal fluorosis in one's lifetime.

4) Does fluoride accumulate in the body?

Yes. Approximately half of each day's fluoride intake will be retained.
This is what makes it so dangerous. "The dose makes the poison." All sides
agree to the fact that healthy kidneys can eliminate only about 50% of
daily fluoride intake. The rest gets stored in calcified tissues, like
bones and teeth.

The National Academy Of Sciences (NAS) stated in 1977 that, for the average
individual, a retention of 2 mg/day would result in crippling skeletal
fluorosis after 40 years. Considering the above mentioned intake level, it
is likely that skeletal fluorosis already affects many millions of people
in the United States.

Children, the elderly and any person with impaired kidney function (which
includes many AIDS patients), are in the high risk group for fluoride
poisoning and must be warned to monitor their fluoride intake. Also at high
risk are people with immunodeficiencies, diabetes and heart ailments, as
well as anyone with calcium, magnesium and Vitamin C deficiencies. (At the
level of 0.4 ppm renal (kidney) impairment has been shown.) (Junco, L.I. et
al, "Renal Failure and Fluorosis", Fluorine & Dental Health, JAMA 222:783 -
785, 1972)

5) How does fluoride get into the water?

Most often as a byproduct from the fertilizer, aluminum and other
industries, who manage to sell this toxic waste to municipalities
nationwide for human consumption -- incredible, but a fact.

6) What about my toothpaste?

Studies show that adults can absorb up to 0.5 mg per "TV ribbon" brushing.
Small children, even if pea-size amount is used, will still absorb the
same, more if the child is younger and has less swallowing control skills.
Half a tube of toothpaste can kill a child. Current content of sodium
fluoride in toothpaste in Canada and the US is up to 0.4% = 4000 ppm (parts
per million). Bubblegum-flavored dentifrice obviously is especially
inviting for children. Since April 1997 all toothpaste in the US must carry
a warning label, advising parents what to do if their child swallows more
than the pea-size brushing amount. Wholesale containers carry the poison
symbol of skull and crossbones.

7) What about the fluoride treatment at the dental office?

Fluoride treatments can contain between 10,000 to 20,000 ppm. There is no
regulated dose requirement. There are cases known of children dying in the
dentist's chair. (New York Times, Jan.20, 1979: "$750,000 Given in Child's
Death in Fluoride Case" about a three year old child killed by fluoride
treatment in the Dentist's office.)

8) How can my dentist say that it's good for my teeth?

By receiving limited training on the subject and being misinformed on
purpose by the American Dental Association. Figures in ADA pamphlets
contain an incredible amount of untruths, and outright fraudulent claims.
If you check the references cited and numbers listed in your local
libraries, you will undoubtedly come to the same conclusion. Some
fluoridation endorsements are listed which prove fraudulent when checked.
Most dentists never bother to take the time to study both sides of the
fluoride issue. Consider this statement by the ADA in 1979: "Individual
dentists must be convinced that they need not be familiar with scientific
reports and field investigations on fluoridation to be effective
participants and that non-participation is overt neglect of personal
responsibility." There are NO reliable studies, conducted under ethical
research guidelines, which prove the benefits of fluoride supplementation.
The FDA admits this! There are more than 500 peer-reviewed studies
documenting the adverse effects. Furthermore, dentists make higher profits
in fluoridated areas and through fluoride use. As a result of mottled
enamel, many more restorative measures are necessary, such as braces,
bridges, etc. For the American and Canadian Dental Associations, this
condition is a real money-maker, because cosmetic dentistry is far more
lucrative than cavity repair. In addition, there is an abundance of
evidence in the scientific literature indicating that fluoride causes a
delay in the normal shedding of the "baby" teeth, and their replacement by
permanent teeth. This delay has been shown to increase the number of
children with malpositioned teeth. Again, braces are far more expensive
than fillings. 

(Note: In a 1972 report by the American Dental Association, it is stated
that dentists make 17% more profit in fluoridated areas as opposed to
non-fluoridated areas.) (Douglas et al., "Impact of water fluoridation on
dental practices and dental manpower", Journal of the American Dental
Association; 84:355-67, 1972) In 1993 the National Academy of Sciences
warned, "dental fluorosis...might be more than a cosmetic defect if enough
fluorotic enamel is fractured and lost to cause pain, adversely affect food
choices, compromise chewing efficiency, and require complex dental treatment."

The International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology has classified
fluoride as an unapproved dental medicament due to its high toxicity.

The FDA considers fluoride an unapproved new drug for which there is no
proof of safety or effectiveness. The FDA does not consider fluoride an
essential nutrient.

Four major studies involving 480,000 children (US, 39,000; Japan, 22,000;
India, 400,000; Tucson, 29,000) comparing fluoridated and non-fluoridated
areas showed no significant difference in decay rates. Proven is that a
higher intake of fluoride will actually cause MORE cavities, especially for
children with low dietary calcium intake.

9) Is it true that fluoride can cause cancer?

Yes. In 1990 fluoride was found to be an equivocal carcinogen by the
National Cancer Institute Toxicology Program. (Maurer, et. al.,"Fluoride an
equivocal carcinogen. J.National Cancer Institute 82, 1118-26, 1990) In
1992 further studies by the New Jersey Department of Health confirmed a 6.9
fold increase in bone cancer in young males. (Cohn, Perry D. Ph.D. "An
Epidemiological Report on Drinking Water" Fluoridation and Osteosarcoma in
Young Males, New Jersey Department of Health, Environmental Health Service,
Trenton NJ November 8, 1992) In 1997 there were more than 80 references
available, linking fluoride to cancer.

10) Is it true that fluoride can increase hip fractures?

Yes. According to Dr. J. William Hirzy (vice-president of the NFFE LOCAL
2050, the union representing all scientists at the EPA, Washington, D.C.)
there have been 5 epidemiological studies done since 1990, in three
different countries, all showing a higher increase in hip fractures in
fluoridated communities.

Some studies have indicated an 87% higher risk of hip fractures to the
elderly in areas where water fluoridation was below 1.5 ppm.

11) Can fluoride cause Osteoporosis and Arthritis?

Yes, most definitely. On July 9, 1998 the Manchester Guardian reported news
of fluoride poisoned water in Central India, from untested wells drilled in
the 1980s, causing severe arthritic damage to tens of millions of people --
a national disaster. Fluoride is the most bone seeking element known to
mankind. The US Public Health Service has stated that fluoride makes the
bones more brittle and dental enamel more porous.

12) Does it cause brain damage?

Yes. Fluorides lower the intelligence capacity of humans, with children,
again, especially susceptible to early fluoride toxicity. IQ levels were
significantly lower than children not exposed to fluorides in all age
groups listed. (According to Dr. Hirzy, 5 to 19 points lower!) (Li, X.S.,
Zhi, J.L., Gao, R.O., "Effects of Fluoride Exposure on the Intelligence of
Children", Fluoride;28:182-189, 1995) Further studies proving the
neurotoxicity of fluoride in rats have also been conducted by Dr. Phyllis
Mullinex and her co-workers. (Note: this also explains a recent University
of South Florida study relating fluoride intake during pregnancy to the
yearly 1% increase in learning disabilities found in children...)

Studies proving that fluorides transfer through the placenta are well
known. (Meanwhile, Dr.Weil, Internet's Health Guru, advocates fluoride
supplements for pregnant women in his book "8 Weeks To Optimum Health"...)

There are also several studies linking aluminum with fluoride, showing that
the bioavailability of aluminum is increased in the presence of fluorides,
causing aluminum in the brain to double in treated animals. According to an
October 28, 1992 Wall Street Journal Article about a study conducted by
Varnier JA, et al.: "Rats fed the highest doses developed irregular mincing
steps characteristic of senile animals.... Post mortem examination of the
rat brains disclosed 'substantial cell loss in structures associated with
dementia -- the neo-cortex and hippocampus'." (Note: Alzheimer's Disease,
first diagnosed by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1907, is now the #4 killer for
every person over 60 in the US. Every 2nd person over 70 will develop
Alzheimer's.) Environmental fluoride is implicated in this.

13) How widespread is this problem?

The US Public Health Service estimates that 1 in 5 children have dental
fluorosis. (By the way, all native reservations in the US have mandatory
fluoridation, resulting in very high incidents of dental fluorosis in those
areas.) Realistic figures are as high as 80% in some areas in the US and as
high as 69% in Canada. Studies have been conducted directly linking bone
tissue damage to children with dental fluorosis. Fluorosis is the first
visible sign that destructive effects of fluoride are also occurring in
bone, connective tissue, immune and enzyme functions.

14) If all this is true, how can fluoridation possibly be sanctioned by
government? In 1939 a dentist named H. Trendley Dean, DDS, examined water
from 345 communities in Texas. Dr. Dean worked for the U.S Public Health
Service (PHS). He determined that high concentrations of fluoride in the
water corresponded to a high incidence in mottled teeth. To many dentists
this provided an answer to the problem of mottled teeth they saw in some of
their patients. Dr. Dean also unexpectedly found a lower incidence of
dental cavities in some communities having about 1 ppm fluoride in the
water supply. Among the native residents of these areas about ten percent
developed the very mildest forms of mottled enamel, sometimes described as
"beautiful white teeth". However, Dean used a technique known as "selective
use of data", using data from 21 cities while completely disregarding data
from 272 other locations which show an almost complete lack of correlation
when plotted. (J. Colquhoun; International Symposium on Fluoridation, Porte
Alegre, Brazil, September 1988) Meanwhile, a number of court cases were
being launched due to fluoride contamination, mainly by the aluminum
industry. In addition the Manhattan Project, the secret atomic bomb
project, was in a big race to build the world's first A-bomb. A pollution
incident of great magnitude occurred at a factory in New Jersey (DuPont)
producing millions of tons of fluoride for the project. A major "negative
PR" problem was emerging, threatening the Manhattan Project and the secrecy
around it. In 1945, supposedly as a result of Dr. Dean's discovery, the PHS
planned to conduct a 10-year study of fluoridation in two cities. Grand
Rapids, Michigan was chosen as the city for artificial fluoridation and
Muskegon, Michigan was the non-fluoridated city for comparison and cavity
rates were to be compared. In 1950, after only five years into the project,
due again to pressure exerted from the atomic bomb program, public health
officials started to campaign for fluoridation. The campaign was based on
the fact that fluoridated Grand Rapids had shown some decrease in cavity
rate. Meanwhile there was also a decrease in cavity rate shown in
non-fluoridated Muskegon. However, Muskegon was dropped from the study for
unknown reasons. After the project was completed, only the Grand Rapids
result was released and a major PR campaign promoting fluoride use started.

15) How about the effects on the environment?

Many studies have been conducted examining the adverse effects of fluoride
on the eco-system. In 1995, the Canadian EPA identified the now closed
Brunswick Mining and Smelting Fertilizer Plant in Belledune, New Brunswick
as having the largest discharge of fluoride to the aquatic environment in
Canada. Toxicity to marine bacteria and impaired reproduction effects were
demonstrated... Agriculture Canada (1976) found that 25 out of 36 cattle
located on several Cornwall Island farms in the Saint Regis Quebec region
displayed real or potential symptoms of chronic fluorosis. A subsequent
study of livestock in this region reported stiffness and inflamed leg
joints, dental fluorosis, osteosclerosis, osteonecrosis and bone
deformations. Many serious toxic and detrimental effects to plants and
animal species have been documented, salmon populations in particluar being
in the high risk category.

IT'S A TOXIC WASTE! Think about it - day after day, unprecedented
quantities of fluoride are deliberately released into the environment,
especially in fluoridated areas. Showers, toilet flushes, lawn sprinkling
... As a result of the original Manhattan Project logic, industries, now
mainly the fertilzer and aluminum industries, have a perfect way to get rid
of their hazardous waste material. It would cost up to $8,000 per truckload
to dispose of this hazardous waste. At a rate of emissions into the air of
155,000 tons/year, in addition to an estimated 500,000 tons of emissions
into lakes, ocean, rivers (not counting fluoridation) - this adds up to
savings of $6 Billion dollars/year to industry! 

16) What do I need to do? How can I protect myself?

If you live in an area with fluoridated water, drink distilled water. You
can have it delivered or buy it at Supermarkets. You can also buy
distilling or reverse osmosis systems for home use which is the only way
for taking fluoride out of the water. Also, eliminate any Teflon of Tefal
coated cookingware, for scratches in the surface will release PTFT, another
toxic fluoride compound. Avoid fruit juices canned or bottled in
fluoridated areas. All non-organic grape products are especially high in
fluoride content due to the number of fertilizer and pesticide
applications. Wine can contain up to 3 ppm fluoride. Avoid using any
toothpaste or mouthrinse containing fluoride. There are many alternatives
on the market. A recent store survey in Vancouver showed over 20 different
brands.

In addition, lobbying is required to demand fluoride content labeling on
commercial products. Steps to educate the public about this proven health
risk and fluoride's toxic properties must be taken immediately and health
advisories issued. Water fluoridation should cease immediately and steps
should be taken to reduce fluoride in food, drink, and dental products. If
you live in a fluoridated area, take action to stop the addition of
fluoride into the water supply. Individuals ARE successful in educating
legislators about the issue and have helped pass laws to stop the addition
of fluoride into the water supply. (Notably Darlene Sherrell, who not only
discovered that the original Roholm/Hodge safety figures had been
mis-calculated and then persisted with the help of Dr. Bob Carton and
Senator Bob Graham in her efforts to get the National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) to adopt the new figures - which had even been corrected by Hodge
himself in 1979 - but also managed to change the law in Michigan, giving
people the right to vote on fluoridation. Michigan was the first state in
the US to repeal their mandatory fluoridation law. Darlene's contact info
is below.)

If Climate Changes, Who Is Vulnerable? Panels Offer Projections

By WILLIAM K. STEVENS
NY Times

If mainstream scientists are right in their forecast that the earth will
warm up substantially in the decades ahead, what will happen to a place
like, say, New England? Will its brilliant fall foliage fade? Its sugar
maples migrate to Canada? Its ski slopes turn to slush? Its tourists vanish? 

As negotiators from around the world struggle to agree on cuts in emissions
of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, scientists are trying to bring the issue
of global warming and attendant changes in climate down out of the
stratosphere of scientific debate and global diplomacy into the everyday
world, where some local officials and citizens are starting to think more
about how the predicted changes might affect them. 

It is not an easy task. Experts find it difficult enough to predict how
temperature and climate will change globally if industrial society
continues to emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. This is mainly
because of imperfections in computer models of the atmosphere on which
global predictions are based. 

Forecasting the regional and local impact of climate change is even harder
because the global models do not deal with climatic change on a regional
and local scale very well. To make matters even more difficult, the global
environment and human economy interact in complex and often unfathomable
ways, creating environmental stresses that could be either worsened or
mitigated by alterations in climate. 

But nothing prevents scientists from zeroing in on areas and activities
that could be vulnerable to the predicted alterations in climate, and they
are doing so more intensively. 

In the case of New England (and upstate New York), for instance, experts
meeting at a federally sponsored workshop at the University of New
Hampshire this month said that the predicted changes do indeed pose a
substantial, though still potential, threat in coming decades to the
region's forests, its winters, its trout fisheries and shoreline
developments -- many of the features, in fact, that together largely define
the region's character. 

In some future autumn, the experts said, the landscape might be dominated
not by the bright oranges, reds and yellows of maples, but by the duller
brown of oaks and hickories that have migrated up from the South. 

New England's very "sense of place" may be at risk, said Dr. Steven
Hamburg, an ecologist at the University of Rhode Island. 

But there will probably be gain as well as pain, winners as well as losers,
and no country or region is likely to be affected in the same way. This
point has been made again and again in the workshops held by the
government's Global Change Research Program. The meetings this year and
next are designed to produce in 1999 a national assessment of the impact of
climate change. 
State and local officials, natural resource managers, businessmen and
others who might have to deal with the effects of a changing climate have
also been attending the meetings, watching and listening to scientists'
slide presentations, and meeting in discussion groups, in the hallways and
at the lunch table to exchange thoughts about what it all might mean. 

In another forum, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an
international group of scientists that advises the climate negotiators
under U.N. auspices, issued a report on Sunday at a meeting in the Maldives
identifying potential losses, gains and widely varying effects from climate
change in different regions of the world. 

On the negative side in North America, for instance, the panel found that
forests and their wild inhabitants in the East and parts of the mountain
West might not be able to migrate northward or upward fast enough or far
enough to adjust to the warming climate. 

The group further concluded that water shortages in the southern plains
could be made worse, that agriculture in the Southeast and southern plains
could be at risk, that deaths from extreme heat in Northern cities could
increase and that coastal development could be threatened by rising seas. 

On the positive side, the panel found that, for example, agriculture in the
Northern United States and southern Canada, on the West Coast and in parts
of the interior West could benefit, as could the magnificent evergreen
forests of the West Coast; that milder winters could cut the number of
cold-weather deaths and the cost of heating and snow clearance; and that
northern waters could be open for navigation longer. In fact, the report
said, the Arctic Ocean might become ice-free, opening a new trade route
between Europe and Asia. 

American society might be able to cope relatively easily with any single
effect of climate change, said Dr. David Shriner, an ecologist at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who was a lead author of the North
American chapter of the intergovernmental panel's report. 
But he said that because there were likely to be several effects, all
occurring at the same time, they would pose "increasing challenges" for
policy makers, resource managers and citizens, especially because any
changes would be difficult to predict. 

One measure of the difficulty is that the intergovernmental panel's
forecast of global warming specifies a wide range of possible increases in
average surface temperature over the next century, from 2 to 6 degrees
Fahrenheit; the panel's best estimate is about 3.5 degrees if greenhouse
gas emissions are not reduced. Moreover, while the earth's surface has
warmed by about 1 degree over the last century, scientists are not sure how
much of that is natural and how much has been caused by greenhouse emissions. 

Still, there are some early signs of actual climate change, and in some
respects they appear in line with experts' admittedly very general notions
of what is vulnerable and what is not. 
A case in point is Alaska, where, scientists at the University of Alaska
said, the average warm-season temperature at Fairbanks has risen by nearly
3 degrees Fahrenheit in the last half-century. While the temperature
reached 80 degrees for about a week in the early 1950s, it now does so for
nearly three weeks. These figures were typical for central Alaska and much
of the western North American Arctic, the scientists said. 

It is possible that this warming could be an expression of the climate
system's natural variability. But it is just the kind of temperature change
the intergovernmental panel predicted; the Arctic is expected to warm more
than the global average (while the tropics are expected to warm less). 

Alaska is already experiencing the low range of the warming the panel
predicted for the globe as a whole by the year 2100, Dr. Glenn Juday, a
forest ecologist at the university in Fairbanks, said at the recent New
England workshop. 

While only time will tell whether the Alaskan warm-up has been caused by
greenhouse gases, Juday said, "the kinds of change you might expect from
global warming are happening" in the state right now. 

The evidence of Alaskan climate change is substantial, the scientists said:
Glaciers have generally receded and typically become about 30 feet thinner
in the last 40 years. There is about 5 percent less sea ice in the Bering
Sea now than in the 1950s. Permafrost is thawing, and as it does, the
ground is subsiding and holes are opening in roads. The thawing has also
led to landslides and erosion, threatening roads and bridges and causing
local floods. 

Traditional ice cellars in northern villages have thawed and become
useless. Melting sea ice has made hunting more dangerous for native people.
More precipitation falls as rain than snow. But where it remains cold
enough to snow, annual snowfall has increased, as would be expected in a
generally warmer and therefore moister global atmosphere. The snow also
melts faster, at least at low altitudes, and the intergovernmental panel
forecasts more running and standing water. 
The state's vast evergreen forests, called taiga, are under climatic siege,
and Juday said their growth rate has gone "into the tank," in lock step
with the temperature rise. 

The new report of the intergovernmental panel said that tundra and taiga in
North America may be reduced by two-thirds in the next century and that the
southern boundary of the area covered by permafrost should shift northward
by about 300 miles over the next 50 years, threatening roads, buildings,
pipelines and other structures. 

But there is good news for the Arctic, too, and there may be more if the
warming is a long-term one. With less snow and more rain in coastal areas,
for instance, there are fewer avalanches. The growing season is longer, and
the intergovernmental panel says that some of the arctic may eventually
open up to farming. 

Less ice offshore could aid oil and gas production, and warmer water could
help fisheries. Heating costs could fall. Tourists could have easier access
to the region. Once the permafrost is finished melting, construction should
be easier than before. 

The Arctic is among the regions most vulnerable to climate change,
according to the panel's report. Other highly vulnerable places, it said,
include small islands, many of which could be all but inundated by rising
seas caused by heat-induced expansion of ocean water and melting ice sheets. 

The report specifically cited the Bahamas, the Maldives and the Pacific
states of Kiribati and the Marshall Islands as examples of the most
threatened spots. It said that as much as 80 percent of the Marshalls'
territory could be drowned by a one-meter, or 3.28-foot, rise in sea level,
which is in the high end of the range predicted by the panel by 2100. (The
best estimate is a rise of about a foot and a half by then, with a
continuing rise after that.) 

Some 70 million people in low-lying areas of Bangladesh could be displaced
by a one-meter rise, the panel said. Such a rise would also threaten the
coastal zone on which Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya sit in Japan, not to mention
China and the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, according to
the panel, and salt water could intrude on inland rivers, threatening some
supplies of fresh water. 

The opposite problem, too little water, could be worsened in arid areas
like the Middle East and parts of Africa, according to the
intergovernmental panel. Global warming is expected to make droughts more
frequent and severe in areas prone to them. 

Largely for this reason, according to the panel, Africa may be the
continent most vulnerable to climate change, because its economy consists
largely of rain-fed agriculture and many of its farmers are too poor and
ill equipped to adapt. 

Australia and parts of Latin America, too, were judged vulnerable to
drought, and the panel projected falling agricultural production for some
major crops in Mexico, Central America and parts of South America. 

On the other hand, increased rainfall in temperate zones, combined with a
warmer climate, longer growing seasons and the fertilizing properties of
atmospheric carbon dioxide, might spur agriculture there. 

Much of the increase in precipitation is expected to come not from the
steady, gentle rains favored by farmers, however, but from heavy storms
that could increase flooding. Evidence of an increase in these heavy storms
has already been detected in North America. Northern Europe, according to
the panel, may be hit by more floods, while southern Europe is more
vulnerable to drought. 

In southern Asia, where hundreds of millions of rural dwellers depend on
the seasonal flow of water from melting snow and ice in the Himalayas,
there might be more water in the short term but less in the long run as
glaciers and snow cover shrink. 

As many of these examples suggest, much of the potential impact of climate
change has to do with changes in the distribution of water around the
world; that is, the planetary hydrological cycle involving evaporation of
water from the earth's surface, precipitation, freezing and melting. 
In North America, for instance, water is the common factor tying together
many impacts across many regions, the intergovernmental panel found. A
warmer climate is expected to affect not only the kinds of weather people
experience -- more severe rainstorms and also more severe droughts -- but
also the availability of water in many regions. Some are likely to get
more, others less. 
Climate change may have serious repercussions for human health, said the
intergovernmental panel. The ranges of mosquito-borne tropical diseases
like malaria, dengue fever and encephalitis and waterborne diarrheal
diseases could expand, for instance. And in a more direct effect,
heat-related summertime deaths are expected to increase in northern
American and European cities, and cold-related deaths to decrease. 

The intergovernmental report said the expected net effect on total deaths
is unclear in Europe, but a leading American expert on the subject said
that in this country, the increase in heat deaths was likely to outweigh
the reduction in deaths from cold. 

The reason, said Dr. Laurence Kalkstein of the University of Delaware, is
that many cold-season deaths are related to diseases like flu, which are
transmitted in closely confined winter quarters. Climate change is not
likely to alter that picture of confinement very much in Northern cities,
he said. 

On the other hand, he told another recent federal workshop at Pennsylvania
State University, summertime heat deaths in Northern cities are almost
certain to rise substantially if the climate warms as predicted. 

First, he said, Northerners are not as acclimatized to heat as Southerners
are. Second, Northern buildings, especially in crowded cities, are not
constructed to promote cooling. Even air-conditioning is no automatic fix,
he said, because many inner-city dwellers cannot afford it. 
"There is no doubt in my mind that we have a problem," he said.

As Alaska Melts, Scientists Consider the Reasons Why
By WILLIAM K. STEVENS - NY Times

VALDEZ, Ala. -- Mighty and majestic, the river of ice snakes down to Prince
William Sound between classically craggy mountains wreathed in clouds.
Through the mist-streaked windows of a light plane, Columbia Glacier's huge
mass and aquamarine-flecked desolation have an almost visceral impact. 

 But like much of the rest of Alaska, the glacier is not what it used to be. 

Not so long ago, cruise ships nosed right up to the glacier's 200-foot-high
front wall to watch icebergs break off and crash into the sound. That is
impossible today. The front has retreated by more than eight miles in the
last 16 years, and ships are separated from it by a vast expanse of melting
icebergs, penned in by a rocky shoal that stretches from where the
shrinking glacier's front wall used to be to where it is now. 

Alaska is thawing, and much of northern Russia and Canada with it, and many
scientists say that the warming of these cold regions is one of the most
telling signals that the planet's climate is changing. Experts have long
said that in an era of global warming, this bellwether region should warm
more and faster than the Earth as a whole, and that is just how things are
turning out. 

The signs are everywhere. 

Scientists employing laser instruments have confirmed that many of Alaska's
hundreds of glaciers are retreating. The warmer atmosphere, which holds
more moisture, has produced more snow to feed the glaciers, but longer,
warmer summers have in many cases melted them even faster than the heavier
snows can build them up. At this time of year, countless streams run full
and chalky with tiny rock particles pulverized to dust by the glaciers. The
region's permafrost, ground that is perpetually frozen, is thawing in
Alaska's interior, and pockets of underground ice trapped in the frost are
melting with it. Over thousands of miles, big patches of forest are
drowning and turning gray as the ground sinks under them and swamp water
floods them. Here and there, deep holes have opened in the earth. Roadside
utility poles, destabilized by the melting, tilt at crazy angles. So do
trees, creating a phenomenon known as drunken forest. 

The intermittent character of the land's subsidence -- the permafrost comes
in patches in most of the state, and not every patch has ice pockets --
wreaks havoc on paved roads. Between here and Fairbanks, 360 miles away,
many stretches of highway are like ocean swells overlaid with irregular
breaks and cracks, and driving on them safely often requires vigilance.
Maintenance crews in the summer are constantly busy not just repairing
roads, but constantly re-repairing them, at substantial cost. 

 Along the Fairbanks-to-Valdez stretch, entire mountainsides of spruce
forest, prime timberland that used to be part of the magnificent taiga, the
vast boreal forest of conifers that rings the world's northern latitudes,
are dead and gray. The trees have been weakened by several climate-related
stresses, then killed by spruce bark beetles whose population, scientists
say, has exploded in the higher temperatures. "It has moved into high gear
in the last six or seven years," said Dr. Glenn Juday, a forest ecologist
at the University of Alaska. "It's just rolling through the forest." 

About the magnitude of the warming, there is little doubt. While the
average surface temperature of the globe has risen over the last century by
1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more, scientists at the University of
Alaska and elsewhere say that it has increased over the last 30 years by as
much as 5 degrees in Alaska, Siberia and northwestern Canada. The warming
has been most pronounced in winter. 

Scientists are not certain how much of the regional warming relates to
over-all warming of the globe, if any. Some of it, they say, is clearly the
result of a change in prevailing patterns of atmospheric circulation,
beginning in the mid-1970s, which generally redirected the flow of warm air
from the Pacific toward Alaska. But researchers like Dr. Gunter Weller, of
the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, an expert on climate change, point
out that big areas of northern Russia not affected by the circulation
change have warmed as much as Alaska. Moreover, say other experts, it is
possible that global warming had something to do with the shift in
circulation. 

A number of experts believe the regional thaw has resulted from a
combination of natural and human-induced climate change. Mainstream
scientists predict that globally, the average surface temperature will rise
by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century, with a best estimate of
about 3.5 degrees, if emissions of heat-trapping industrial waste gases
like carbon dioxide are not reduced. The gases are produced by burning
fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. 

The scientists say that Alaska and other far northern continental regions
should warm about twice as much as the average for the globe. Two main
reasons lie behind this: As ice and snow melt, less heat is reflected off
the land, amplifying the warming. And at these latitudes, the atmosphere is
more stable in winter and spring. This confines more heat to its lower
layers. 

Whatever the combination of causes of Alaska's warming, the catalog of
effects is substantial. 

Thirty years ago, the temperature at Fairbanks reached 80 degrees for only
about a week in the summer. Now it hits or exceeds that mark for a total of
about three weeks. On average, Juday says, a summer day is about 11 percent
warmer than it was three decades ago. 

When Weller moved to Fairbanks 30 years ago, winter temperatures frequently
dipped well below minus-40. In the last two decades, the number of
sub-40-degree days has dropped substantially compared with the three
preceding decades. 

In the Bering Sea, scientists have found, the amount of sea ice has
decreased by about 5 percent over the last 30 years. In Nanana, inland near
Fairbanks, people since 1917 have taken great pains to record the exact
moment when the Tanana River ice breaks up each spring. A lucrative lottery
depends on the result. Four of the earliest breakups in that 81-year span
have been in the 1990s. 

In the interior, higher temperatures have been accompanied by more snow in
the winter (as is well known, extreme cold means a drier atmosphere and
less precipitation), but also less rain in the summer. For agriculture (the
potential of which is in any case limited by a scarcity of suitable Alaskan
land), the warming has been a double-edged sword. The good news is that the
growing season is about 20 percent longer; the bad news is that sufficient
water for crops is often lacking. 

"It's changed dramatically since the '80s," said Scott Miller, who farms a
big, flat spread of barley, oats and hay that is about a two-hour drive
south of Fairbanks, within sight of the snow-capped Alaska Range. There,
with a brilliant sun beating down and the temperature heading toward 80,
Miller explained that in the 1980s, it rained practically all summer, and
there was a danger of frost in July. "Now," he said, "we're way on the
other end of the spectrum; we're usually hurting for water, and there's
more heat." 

On the other hand, according to the 1997 study, longer summers have allowed
the state's vibrant tourist industry to expand. Other long-range benefits
are expected. Shipping in the region should become easier, and an
open-water sea route between Alaska and Europe could open up. The
contraction of sea ice could allow more offshore oil drilling. Warmer water
could help some fisheries. 

But at the moment, the warming is perhaps most evident in its effects on
forests, permafrost and glaciers. 

On a clear summer day a few miles southwest of Fairbanks, from where the
gleaming white pyramid of Mount McKinley rose through hazein the distance,
Juday knelt on the floor of the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest, a
long-term ecological research reservation. A vintage old-growth forest of
white spruce not far from the Arctic Circle, it is in the middle of the
taiga. Moss-covered logs litter the ground. The spruces themselves, their
short, needled branches draped with feathery lichens much like Spanish
moss, tower overhead, straight and tall, rising to 100 feet. 

"We're talking about the cream of the crop -- the very best forests we have
in interior Alaska," Juday said. As he spoke, he set up a hand-held global
positioning instrument and contacted overhead satellites to fix the spot's
coordinates. The purpose was to aid airborne scientists who later would
survey the forest for climate-related damage -- in this case, the extent to
which the crowns of the big spruces have been snapped off by heavy snows. 

Normally, the snows at that latitude are light and fluffy. But recently
they have become heavier, apparently a result of the changing climate. The
weight of two especially heavy snowfalls in the late 1980s and early 1990s
broke off the tops of trees. "There was an incredible outbreak of insects
following that," and they attacked the trees, Juday said as he pointed out
two topless spruce giants. 

On top of that, he said, the warming climate, coupled with less summer
precipitation, has stunted trees' growth. The crowns of aspens, for
instance, look especially puny, and that is where the recent growth would
have taken place. Besides promoting a bigger buildup of tree-eating insects
in general, the warming has prompted some species, like the spruce budworm,
to move farther north. 

"These trees are in real trouble," Juday said. "We've got a sick forest
here." 

Farther south, much of the forest is more than sick; it is dead or dying.
In a broad swath stretching for 300 or 400 miles along the state's southern
tier, from the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage past the spectacular
Chugach Mountains north and northeast of here, chunks of landscape have
turned red (freshly killed) or gray (long dead). Spruce bark beetles are
the killers, and they are "basically eliminating the forest canopy," said
Jerry Boughton, who heads the U.S. Forest Service's regional forest health
program, based in Anchorage. Scientists estimate that a third to half of
Alaska's white spruce have died in the last 15 years. 

Several factors have combined to produce this ecological holocaust, said
Boughton, not least the fact that the forest is older, and therefore more
vulnerable to insect attack. "But certainly, the warming has created a
better environment for the bark beetle to expand," he said. In fact,
mainstream scientists say, that is how the predicted global warming would
often make itself felt: by exacerbating stresses of many kinds. 

Many experts expect the taiga to migrate slowly north, replacing treeless
tundra, if the warming continues or intensifies. In other regions of the
world, other species from farther south would normally move in behind them.
But in Alaska, which is bounded on the south by ocean, it is unclear what
will happen. 

"I don't know of any trees in the Gulf of Alaska," Juday said. 

Dr. Vladimir Romanovsky, formerly of Moscow State University but now of the
University of Alaska, has seen lots of permafrost; it is his area of
expertise. But if he wants to see firsthand what can happen when permafrost
melts, he need look no farther than the field next to his mother-in-law's
home outside Fairbanks. There, a hole, 15 feet long, 6 feet across and 8
feet deep has recently opened in the ground. 

The hole, doomed saplings and sod lying in the bottom, is a thermokarst: a
sinking plot of ground caused by thawing permafrost. Growing numbers of
thermokarsts now abound in Alaska. 

Construction has long been known to thaw permafrost if not undertaken with
care, but now something different is happening. A thicker layer of
insulating snow in the winter, combined with warmer summer weather, is
causing undisturbed permafrost to thaw, creating an uneven and sometimes
crater-pocked landscape. 

Thawing permafrost has forced the relocation of roads and runways.
Agricultural fields have been damaged and houses have tilted off kilter.
Roads and bridges have been abandoned, as has a hospital in the town of
Kotzebue. Even the site for the university's building for international
arctic research, under construction in Fairbanks, had to be moved. 

Along interior roads, drivers can see the telltale sign of sinking ground:
a stand of larch, its branches looking delicate and spidery, but gray
rather than green, standing in the water of a stretch of muskeg, or
subarctic swamp. When a thermokarst develops the swampy water fills it, and
the trees die. 

Romanovsky said measurements from boreholes drilled into the ground show
many areas are mere tenths of a degree from the melting point and will thaw
if the warming continues. If the warming runs its course as predicted,
thermokarsting will eventually be complete, the permafrost line will have
moved north by 300 miles or so (it has already migrated 80 miles in the
last century in some places), and a new stability will have set in, making
construction and maintenance easier than before the thaw. The transition is
the problem. 

When the Columbia Glacier was first studied a century ago, it was advancing
so rapidly that blocks of ice would fall on trees in its path. The advance
stopped about 1923 and was followed by a slight pullback. More recently the
glacier was stable, its leading edge anchored to a broad underwater shoal
of rocky debris, called a moraine, that the glacier had pushed ahead of it
as it advanced. Each summer the glacier would fall back a bit, but would
advance in the winter and re-attach itself to the moraine. 

Then, in 1983, it failed to re-attach, and the retreat was on. It has been
retreating toward the shore at an average rate of about half a mile a year
since. The moraine pens up the 8-mile field of icebergs that holds ships
away from the glacier's front. 

What touched off the pell-mell pullback? "My belief is that it is climate,"
said Dr. Will Harrison, a geophysicist at the University of Alaska, who is
an expert on glaciers. One theory is that the warmer environment prevented
the glacier from re-attaching itself to the moraine after the seasonal
summer fallback. "Once climate kicks it off, you can't stop it," Harrison
said of the retreat. "Once the bullet's fired, that's it." Many climate
experts believe that in general, abrupt changes like this, rather than
gradual ones, are likely to typify a warming climate. 

Alaska has more than 1,000 glaciers, big and small, and together they make
up the fourth-largest collection of ice in the world, after Antarctica,
Greenland and the neighboring Queen Elizabeth Islands of the high Arctic.
And as is true of mountain glaciers generally, many of Alaska's are
retreating, and the retreat has accelerated in recent years. 

Recent mapping of a sampling of nine glaciers, said Harrison, has revealed
that all have thinned substantially at lower elevations, probably because
of increased melting in the summer. But at higher elevations, most of the
glaciers have thickened, probably because of increased winter
precipitation. Still, in most instances, the melting at the base of the
glaciers has outstripped the new ice provided by winter snows, and the
trend has been especially pronounced in the last five years. "Something's
happened here," Harrison said. 

Indeed. 

Given the uncertainty of climate predictions, the future is unclear. "But
each year and each month that the temperature doesn't drop down," said
Juday, "is confirmation that the whole system has been kicked up" to a new
climatic state.

 Hello my friends,
 
 Things move too swiftly sometimes for me to keep up.  As you might be
 aware, several of us have deciphered much of the note Gen. Ramey is
 holding in his hand in the infamous "Ramey/DuBose" photo taken by James
 Bond Johnson over 51 years ago.  The "translation" was performed
 indendently at at least two locations and achieved an outstanding degree
 of correlation.  Each team member worked from a 16 x 20 print made from
 the original negatives available from the UTA archives.  The file from
 which I worked is a scanned image of solely the message and is 821
 megabytes (this from an approximate 1" x 3/8" image size!).  Because of
 the differing image intensities we were required to vary the brightness
 and contrast of different areas of the image in order to best resolve
 the individual characters.  Translation took 3 to 4 hours.  
 Several factors assisted us.  
 *		First, it was a non-proportional type, meaning each
 character and space occupied the same amount of space 	(unlike today's
 ever-popular proportional type); 
 *		Second, all the letters are upper-case; third we had
 large-format images.  
 *		Third, today's equipment is sufficiently capable to
 enable us to perform this task
 
 Yesterday evening Bond and I presented the preliminary results to an
 excited audience at MUFON Orange County's monthly meeting.  The
 highlight of the presentation was enabling the audience to actually READ
 some elements of this hithertofore "hidden" message.  There was no doubt
 in anyone's mind that had Gen. Ramey read this note BEFORE Johnson took
 his photos they would never have seen the light of day and we would not
 have this vital clue to enable us to solve one more element in the

     Additional Details About Secret Space Station Revealed
     by
     Richard Boylan, Ph.D.


     The ex-NSA informant, who provided information on a secret U.S.-USSR
manned space station in orbit since 1968, now has furnished me additional
details about its
operation. 

     The space station has been serviced by secret military spacecraft long
before the first American Space Shuttle flew in 1981. Then, in 1988,
previous spacefaring
vehicles were superseded by the "Nautilus", a spacecraft with a rounded
delta shape, built
jointly by special projects divisions of Europe's Airbus Industrie and
U.S.'s Boeing Corporation.

	Nautilus has a propulsion system which utilizes magnetic pulsing. 

      Nautilus-type craft make twice-weekly trips up into space and back, to
service the secret international space station. The Nautilus is based in
Utah. (Although my
informant did not identify the base, the likely candidates are the Dugway
Proving Grounds, Utah, with one of the longest runways in the world, or
Hill Air Force Base Range, in an extremely remote location.)
     
Nautilus-class craft were also used at the beginning of the Gulf War, to
penetrate Iraqi airspace from space. Soon thereafter, Stealth aircraft took
over covert
penetration operations.

Political Science 101:          ET Disclosure Policy Split

         There is a deep division within the Bilderberg Group, mirrored in the
other world management policy bodies, the Council on Foreign Relations, the
Royal Institute of International Studies and the Trilateral Commission, as
well
as within the Departments of Defense and the Intelligence agencies of the U.S.
and NATO countries, between those (the Enlightened Minority) who feel it's
time
to go public with ET contact and present the cumulative experience with ETs as
non-threatening, and those  (The Benighted Majority) who advocate keeping ET
contact hidden while studying ETs further to find their weaknesses in order to
continue to refine weapons to repel them, because ETs threaten the current
"elite"'s monopoly on the apparatus of wealth, power and status.
         Bilderberg, CFR, TLC, etc. were built to serve their elite masters.
The progressives therein can advocate for enlightened world management
policies. But they have to see if the majority go along with such policies.
The
selfish majority don't when some powerful faction's economic ox (e.g. the
Dutch
royal family's profitable ownership of [Royal Dutch] Shell [Petroleum. Ltd.])
is about to be gored (e.g. by potential release of nonpolluting Zero-Point
Energy [ET] technology.)

            Dr. Michael Wolf of the National Security Council and my ex-NSA
source (and others, such as Colonel Steve Wilson, USAF, Colonel Donald Ware,
USAF, Command Sergeant-Major Robert Dean, USA, etc.)  are part of the
Enlighted
Minority within the Intelligence and military organizations, who feel its time
for UFO  reality to come out. They aren't waiting for the Benighted
Majority to
give permission. Thus we are being treated to an extraordinary level of
substantive UFO/ET disclosures from authoritative sources.
        Those who won't accept UFO reality until they hear it from the
President's lips may have to wait a while longer. But anyone who cares to
attend to what _other_ governmental figures are disclosing can find
substantial
documentation of the reality of UFOs and ET contact.

Check out the UFO renditions on the CSETI Website from the following
independent sources.

a) S-4 Physicist Bob Lazar http://www.cseti.org/crashes/188.htm

b) Cosmonaut Victor Afanasyev
http://www.cseti.org/position/addition/russian.htm

c) Testors Model forensic design engineer Bill MacDonald
http://www.cseti.org/crashes/016.htm , who researched the configuration of
the crashed Roswell craft for four years using a diverse group of military
and intelligence sources.

All the reports depict the same style of "Wave-Rider" craft, and all
reports were filed completely independently and at different times.

Then check out LoFLYTE, Winner of Popular Science's 1996 "Best of What's
New", at http://www.accurate-automation.com/projects/loflyte/photobook.htm 

The plane will "ride" the hypersonic shock wave that it produces for
improved efficiency. LoFLYTE is a high-lift, low-drag Mach 5 aircraft
concept that utilizes neural network technology in a number of unique ways
to improve maneuverability, reliability, and efficiency. Neural networks
are a biologically motivated form of computation.

LoFLYTE(tm) is jointly funded by Air Force and NASA Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) programs, using additional technology developed
under SBIR programs funded by the Navy, the National Science Foundation,
and the National Aerospace Plane Joint Program Office. Supporting
subcontractors include: Lockheed Martin, McDonnell Douglas, Mississippi
State University's Raspet Flight Research Laboratory, Rockwell
International, Pratt & Whitney, and SWB Turbines.

Robert Pegg of the hypersonic vehicles office at Nasa's Langley research
centre says the software is needed to control a craft that could eventually
travel at more than 3,000mph. 

"At those high speeds, things happen so quickly that the pilot cannot
control the aircraft as easily as at subsonic speeds," he says. 

The aircraft's neural networks are designed to have more in common with the
human brain than with computers. They consist of many separate chips that
communicate with one another at high speed so they can learn, or be taught,
how to react to varying situations. 

John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists in Washington DC, closely follows developments in high-speed
aircraft and believes that the unveiling could lead to an admission that a
top-secret full-scale version of the plane is in operation. 

"I continue to be puzzled by the vast number of theoretical studies into
the waverider configuration that apparently have no basis in existing
hardware," he says in the UK's Sunday Times. "The public showing of the
LoFlyte vehicle is very odd. It leads me to the conclusion that there may
well be classified work going on in which that hardware exists." 

Reports of unidentified, triangular aircraft have risen in the past few
years, leading some aviation experts to a similar conclusion to Pike's.  

Looks to me like someone cheated on the test.

Scalar Energy Abuse

"Working in scalar energy can do a lot of good as well as a lot of bad,"
says Tom Bearden. 

"Let's talk about some good and bad things you can do in terms of human
beings. First of all, a Russian scientist named Kosnochev, who headed up a
research institute in Siberia in those days, did some enormously important
work.... 

"As far as everybody else is concerned [he demonstrated] openly just normal
electromagnetics -- but it wasn't. It was special stuff. He demonstrated
that ANY KIND OF CELLULAR DISEASE WHATSOEVER, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CAN BE
CAPTURED AND TRANSMITTED INTO OTHER CELLS AT A DISTANCE USING THIS SPECIAL
KIND OF ELECTROMAGNETICS. 

"They did about 18,000 experiments, and research institutes can prove this.
And so, of course, the KGB and so forth started weaponizing that effect
very highly. You know for years [they used] the so-called microwave
radiation on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, where they induced all kinds of
health changes. This was a limited test deliberately kept very small,
although they did kill three ambassadors."

Lt. Col. Bearden goes on to say: 

"It's the ultimate biological warfare, of course. I'll say this flatly, and
then I won't answer any further questions about it: the Gulf War Syndrome
was induced.... 

"It was induced with this stuff. All the rest ... 

"was contributing factors that everybody's talking about. Yeah, you had a
little bit of nerve gas released, yeah, you had some chemicals, yeah, you
had this, but not everybody got those exposures.... 

"It was a test."

Majoring in Martians
by Kristen Philipkoski 

11:59 a.m.  2.Oct.98.PDT

We are not alone. 

And the University of Washington is likely to make first contact. This week
the Seattle-based university announced the creation of a graduate program
to train students in the search for extraterrestrial life. 

Officials say that the University of Washington is the first to offer a
doctorate in astrobiology, where students compare extreme environments on
Earth to those on other planets, such as Mars and Europa, one of Jupiter's
moons. The program will begin in the fall semester of 1999, and is funded
from a five-year, US$2 million National Science Foundation grant, plus
$500,000 from the university. 

"I think this is really exciting," said Chris Chyba, the Carl Sagan chair
for the study of life in the universe at the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence Institute. "For the first time in a quarter century, the field
is returning to this question of looking for life elsewhere. We did it with
Viking in '76, and they had to look at Mars using the technology of the
early '70s. Now we’ve got 25 more years of technology." 

Graduates will be able to receive degrees in 11 areas, with an emphasis in
astrobiology. Students can choose from oceanography, astronomy, aeronautics
and astronautics, genetics, chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology,
atmospheric sciences, geophysics, geological sciences, or history as their
core focus of study. 

"What's special about it is it's a cross-disciplinary curriculum of
physical and biological sciences," said James Staley, a UW microbiology
professor and director of the astrobiology program. 

The goal of the astrobiology doctorate program, which is expected to enroll
about 12 students, is to make analogies between extreme environments on
Earth and environments on other planets, Staley said. 

"Our theme is that we'd like to study environments on earth as models of
environments that might exist in Europa or Mars," he said. "The ocean has
hydrothermal vents (like undersea volcanoes) and there is life associated
with these environments... which might be an analogue for life on Mars
beneath the surface. The sea ice at the North and South poles, which covers
10 percent of the oceans, has a microbial community of very cold-loving
organisms. We think the sea-ice community might be an analogue for life on
Europa." 

Chyba said the discovery of a deep biosphere within the Earth has rekindled
interest in searching for life on other planets. "If organisms can live a
mile down into the Earth, they may have retreated there on Mars," he said. 

Scientists have gathered circumstantial evidence of an ocean on Europa,
raising hopes of eventually discovering life there. "Exobiologically, that
would make Europa one of the most exciting places," Chyba said. 

NASA apparently agrees, since it plans to put a spacecraft in orbit above
Europa in 2003 to try and confirm the existence of an ocean. If one is
found, the moon will be extensively studied. Chyba predicts that Mars
missions will also start bearing fruit within a decade. 

"It’s no longer purely a theoretical field," Chyba said. "People have to
think hard about how to interpret and do experiments." 

Until now, students interested in exploring extraterrestrial life have had
to tailor their curriculums through conventional means. This might mean
majoring in astronomy while taking courses in molecular biology or
microbiology. 

Some schools, the University of Arizona for example, offer a PhD program in
planetary sciences, and a minor in astrobiology. And the NASA Specialized
Center of Research and Training developed a doctorate program at the
University of San Diego focusing on exobiology, which studies the origins
of life. 

Rachel Mastrapa, a PhD candidate who is pursuing a minor in astrobiology at
the University of Arizona, said she sees many graduate students interested
in astrobiology. 

"In some ways I’m the guinea pig," she said. "My success could dictate
whether or not they put a lot of money into a [major] program. I hope to
see it progress to an official major." 

For students with backgrounds in astronomy and geology, the biological
science courses can be challenging, Mastrapa said. "I’m taking a course in
organic chemistry to catch up, and next semester I’ll have to take
microbiology. But if the major works out, they could tailor the program to
people coming in from different backgrounds." 

With funding from The National Science Foundation and the cropping up of
university programs, the field of astrobiology is likely to move well
beyond studying suspicious circular formations in Iowa cornfields.

Subject: [CAUS updates] -  CAUS v. Department of the Army--Uodate 
Date: Monday, October 05, 1998 5:53 PM

Dear CAUS Subscribers:

The US Attorneys Office, on behalf of the Army, has submitted its Motion
for Summary Judgment (dismissal) and in support of its motion it has
submitted affidavits from various personnel swearing to the adequacy and
scope of the search.

The following areas were searched without success:

1) Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development
and Acquisition (SARDA) This office had taken over responsibilities for the
Office of the Chief of Research and Development (OCORD) where Corso was
assigned. In particular all SF 135s documenting SARDA record transfers for
the years 1960-1970. The search included a visual and physical check of the
records and files, and electronic checks of all current, historical and
archived paper and computer files maintained by SARDA Information
Management Office, as well as historical files transferred to storage.

2) Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and Office of Surgeon General (OTSG) A
search was conducted of all their current and historical paper and
electronic records, reasonable or remote.

3) Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) A search was conducted of all
their current and historical paper and electronic records, reasonable or
remote. Though no records were found responsive to the CAUS request, CAUS
did receive a large amount documents from INSCOM pertaining to WWII era
German flying wing aircraft which were, according to the Army, 'perceived
as UFOs or flying saucers.'

The US Attorneys Office maintains that the Army has performed a 'reasonable
search' which is all that the law requires.  It now asks the Court to
dismiss the CAUS lawsuit.  The lawsuit will be dismissed unless I can argue
that the Army's search was either in bad faith or unreasonable under the
circumstances. The law is also clear that only a 'reasonable' search is
required...not an 'exhaustive' search and the mere fact that documents
might have existed at one time is not evidence that they exist at the
present time.

Since Colonel Corso is no longer alive to assist CAUS with its response,
CAUS is seeking member guidance as whether there are other areas within the
Army that should have been searched for responsive documents.  Any such
recommendation must be supported by some arguable reason to believe that
the documents would be found there.  Prior to the Colonel's death, he had
informed me that on several occasions he had personally attempted to have
the Army locate his files but without success.

Director

This is another side of the Implant  Story...


All sides must be considered !
 

From: Virgil Priscu 
I think I have to react to the above mentioned posting because I feel
that people with interest in the UFO field can be mislead by the
information presented. 


I am a physician, specialist in anesthesiology, head of a Department in
a teaching hospital in Israel. I have also a long time interest in UFO
phenomena. 
I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Derrel Sims personally during a recent
visit he made in Israel.At that occasion he presented in front of a
small audience some of the results of his research. 


Let me point out some details: 
Dr. R. Lear, Mr. Sims' collaborator is not a physician (MD), and much
less a "surgeon", but a podiatrist (licenced to make small surgical
interventions on the foot only.)  Mr Simms could be a "qualified
Hypnotherapist" - I do not know. 


What I know for sure is that Mr Sims stories have medical inaccuracies
regarding details of the operations performed for the removals of what
he and his organisation (FIRST) claims to be "implants" (with all the
implications of this term -in the way it is used -namely implying to
describe an object manufactured by extraterrestrial beings with the
purpose of monitoring/controling humans, etc.) 


Absolutely no evidence of such was presented by Mr. Sims at the
presentation which I personally witnessed. I could add that he became
visibly disturbed when I asked him specific questions regarding the
alleged "implants" and he gave inadequate answers regarding such
specific topics as the dose of local anesthetic used for the extraction
of the so called "implants". 


I specifically asked him to provide me with color slides of the actual
pathological specimens that he extracted from the subjects studied. He
declined under various motives. 


No other evidence or specimen was available to my specific request. I
asked him for such because I have the possibility to made them examined
by some of my friends either in the pathology Dpt of my Medical Center,
The Forensic Medical Institute at Abu Kabir or at The Weizmann Institute
in Rehovot - Israel. 


No specimen, pathological slide or other material was available from Mr.
Sims for examination by an independent specialist or laboratory - as I
have asked. 
I am afraid that all claims made by Mr Sims or his associates have not
been confirmed or underwent a pair review process, therefore I
personally have serious doubts as to the veracity of those claims. 


I would like to emphasize that I am a physician with about 20 years of
experience in the operating room, in the field of anesthesiology and
emergency medicine.  I know a thing or two about what we call "Foreign
Bodies" (FB) found quite often, especially in the feet of some
unsuspecting patients by an incidental X Ray made for another purpose. 


They get there by a variety of methods : waking or playing bare foot on
the beach, grass etc, and not noticing when the FB is getting in.
(during a fall, running, getting hurt by some other bigger object from
which a small splinter can get into one's foot and remain there for
many, many years under the skin - until sometimes they are discovered by
chance while some other physician or medical practitioner - like a
podiatrist - is examining the patient for another, unrelated complain -
and sometimes X Ray their feet!) If it is a substance that degrade
slowly, then after years only a small notch of"reaction" tissue remains
in the place of the former FB. It is composed of human tissue components
- etc.. No mystery, no "implants". 


This is my two cents of caution about the above mentioned subject. 
I firmly belive that "UFO phenomena" exist. 


I also firmly belive that meticulous research by competent persons is
the way to the truth. 


Sincerely yours: 
Virgil Priscu MD

The acid test for any revolutionary discovery--entry to the marketplace--is
happening
right now for cold fusion, whether or not the critics agree. It is now
possible to acquire for
research purposes - a low-power, radiationless, tabletop nuclear reactor
for less than
$4,000!

Hot fusion has never produced a single watt of excess energy, and if it
ever does it would
be in the form of lethal radiation. Cold fusion, whose primary signature is
excess heat with
no deadly radiation, exceeded breakeven at birth -- in 1989.

Already, former chairman of the House Science Committee, Rohert Walker
(R-PA), has
publicly acknowledged the reality, importance, and mystery of cold fusion.

Many other "establishments" -- including the planet's entire fossil fuel
and fission power
infrastructure -- are also in for rude awakenings. Even hydropower, solar,
and windmill
energy, which may still have their place in the coming New Energy Age, will be
marginalized. It will be extremely difficult, even for contemporary
"sustainable energy", to
compete with compact, environmentally benign power systems that do not bow
to Earth's
rotation, or the vagaries of weather. The electric power grid will wither
away as
consumers increasingly adopt self contained domestic power units based on
cold fusion,
or "new hydrogen energy," as the Japanese official program calls it. Air
pollution will
plummet, and the threat of global warming will dissipate.

While the cold fusion triumph is astonishingly good news for the
environment, and the
energy well-being of civilization, It is extremely bad news for
business-as-usual,
incremental science. Mainstream scientific publications have been loathe to
recognize
what has been happening these past eight years in laboratories from Los
Alamos to
Beijing.

Both the nuclear-scale energy production and nuclear products -- low-energy,
alchemy-like transmutation of heavy elements in cold fusion -- have now
been proved.
The energy release observed so far from cold fusion reactions is slow
(fortunately!) but
spectacular: thousands to millions of times beyond any conceivable chemical
reaction in
those systems. Tens, hundreds, and thousands of megajoules per mole of
active material
in the cells, for those who understand those terms. Moreover, there are no
chemical
changes in cold fusion systems that could begin to explain the energy
release -- much less
the nuclear reaction products found: transmuted heavy elements, helium-4,
occasionally
radioactive tritium, and an extremely faint neutron emission (the latter
often nonexistent,
or very near ambient background level).

To be sure, these are provocative conclusions about one of the most
reviled, disputed
anomalies in the history of science.

They will provide historians with a fascinating view of skepticism run
amok. They are
each good examples of Arthur C. Clarke's observation in l963: "It is really
quite
amazing by what margins competent but conservative scientists and engineers
can miss the mark, when they start with the preconceived idea that what
they are
investigating is impossible. When this happens, the most well-informed men
become blinded by their prejudices and are unable to see what lies directly in
front of them"

The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) final report on its $10
million cold fusion
research states: "This work confirms the claims of Fleischmann, Pons, and
Hawkins of the
production of excess heat in deuterium loaded palladium cathodes at levels
too huge for
chemical transformation... . Further, the excess energy exceeds that of
known chemical
processes by two or more orders of magnitude."

Drs. Fleischmann and Pons have been vindicated by EPRI, but in other ways too.
Leaving the hostility of the U.S. scientific establishment behind.

The European patent office has given notice to U.S.-based cold fusion
company ENECO
of Salt Lake City that the Pons and Fleischmann patent will be approved.
Not so in the
U.S., as the war rages in Washington against cold fusion. The Department of
Energy
continues massive funding for various hot fusion programs and fission power
research, but
not one cent has been allocated for cold fusion. Any research on cold
fusion at national
labs has been either "bootlegged" under duress, or paid for out of
"director's discretionary
funding.'
