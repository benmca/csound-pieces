Hello everyone,

	I had a brief look at everything, and it all looks great!  I've had a couple of thoughts while I've been editing, and am noticing a few 'not so obvious' pairs of objects aren't being linked:

	Fingerings to their respective notes - I know sometimes this isn't practical or 		appropriate.  Wherever possible is fine.

	Pedal marks to the event list of the measure they fall in.

	Braces to Staves - Very important!

	When the formatter sees these unlinked, I think it assumes their free-floating text or something, and scatters them everywhere.  At any rate, it's part of the 1st pass process until the formatter wises up. ;)  Email me questions anytime.  Thanks.

Ben

Hi everyone,

	A couple quick rules of thumb we should try to stick to:

	1) Grace notes borrow (or steal, depending on how you look at it) time from the note PRECEDING them.  This, I've been told, wasn't the case with mid-17th century stuff (Mozart I think?) you guys have worked on in the pass.  This was an exception to a general grace note rule: they're always linked to the preceding note, unless specified.

	2) In a lot of this romantic piano stuff there are slurs over the 3 denoting a triplet.  Let's not use these, since they are outdated and crash the formatter.  The Chopin some of us have been working on is full of these.  The slur is usually just around the three, and isn't remotely big enough or placed correctly to be a normal slur.  If in doubt, go ahead and put it in, since I will be looking for them anyway.

That's it for now.  Everything looks good. 

Thanks,

Ben

Hello everyone,

	Some stuff is coming up repeatedly that I thought I might bring up to you all, particularly on grace notes.  The formatter is VERY picky with these, so I'm repeatedly crashing with no ability to assess the situation except "it has something to do with grace notes."  So, I think if we follow some simple, although odd guidelines we'll be getting things on the website quicker.

	1) I had said before to link the grace note to the note behind it, but this isn't always the best case.  If there is a barline between the two notes, everything messes up, I have to delete and re-enter from scratch all notes involved. Link these grace notes to the note ahead of them. Also, we need to make sure, even if the formatter entered the grace note, that it's linked to the appropriate event list. Very important.

	2) If the grace note is the same pitch as the note preceding it, don't link them.

	3) I realize saying the "previous note" wasn't entirely accurate.  The grace note steals time from whatever you link it to.  The grace note, then, needs to be linked to the note OR REST behind it.  Sorry this was unclear.

That's about it for now.  Thanks for your patience and indulgence.  Talk to you soon.


Ben

Hi,

Hi Everyone,

	I want to ease everyone into setting some things on the the pages up, since, lately, the debugging has been particularly time-consuming for me.  I attached a file Gary gave to the final editors a little while ago, which explains what style guidelines we have.  I'd like you all to follow what's marked for the title, subtitle and composer on page one.  Don't bother with more than what's on the style doc; i.e. don't bother with arrangers.  The document should be fairly straightforward, but you know what to do if there are ???s.  Thanks - this will really save me some time!

Note to everyone:

	Ornament linears must be linked to all notes they affect.  For Example, a vertical squiggly line, denoting an arpeggio, must be linked to all notes in the chord.  In addition, you must go into the edit box, and change it to an arpeggio (default is trill). Thanks!

Hi you guys!

	Sorry I've been so out of touch lately, but I had a vacation and came back to all the Warner's stuff.  I've had to shelf all our work for these tunes, so I'm way behind on questions specific to files. Bear with me; I'll catch up soon enough!

	Regarding which build: I suggest you all grab 104c, 104d, and 105g from store, and edit in 104d.  This seems to be stable, though has some glitches like all the others.  Let me know of horrible, life threatening problems.  Thanks!

Hi you guys,

	I thought I'd take a sec to tell you where I'm at in terms of you're repspective files.  I want to know if I've left any questions unanswered, so please tell me if you had questions (check your previous emails, if you still have them) regarding the pages I've finished.

	Miriam and Jennifer: I've done up to and including page 57 of the mppp collection.

	Margaret:  I should be finished up to 70 today, though 55-66 are on hold right now, for reasons I'm sure you're aware of.

	Jayne:  I;ve finished up to 48.  These are more difficult than you'd think! 

	Let me know of any questions you hae and any pieces you want copies of.  You guys are doing a marvelous job.  Keep it up!

Howdy all,

	A few things: 

	1) Please take care to delete any extraneous icons you add (eg time signatures at the top of pages) to a page before sending it to me.

	2) Make sure that text objects are linked to the measures they should be.  Sometimes, a text object is created too close to the system above or below the intended one, which really screws formatting up, and can take awhile to find (since it isn't caught by the error check).

	3) If there is a measure with less than the appropriate number of beats, such as at the final ending of a section which repeats, be sure to change the event list to 'notated time' from 'time signature'.  I assume you know how to do this, PLEASE email me if not.  

	4) You guys are going to hate this, but this is what I've been told to do:  please go through all dynamics within a page, and change the volume to 100 from 76.  I know, I know, a ROYAL pain, but I'm to have it done!  Sorry.  :)  This one is imporatant.  We are getting reports that the file playback too softly on some machines.


Thankyousomuch!

Ben

PS:	When shall we have another conference call??  Everyone email me with times, or Let me know when you are all in the same vicinity, like last time we did this.  Thanks!

Hi everyone,

	Because I've become overloaded with pages from you guys, we're moving Jayne and Margaret to another finish editor: Ian Rashkin.  Please email him and introduce yourselves.  His email is enr@oz.net.  
	What does this mean to you?  You will get answers to your questions much faster, and have feedback on your work from a different angle, which can be very beneficial.  Also, you may have to resend some questions, since I haven't gotten to many you have already asked.  I am forwarding Ian my backlog; he is getting file emwa2_12.rms onward from Jayne, and bw25_075.rms onward from Margaret.  Please email ME if you need clarification as to who has what.
	It's been great working with you and I'm sure we'll do more together in the future.  Thanks a lot.

I am a composition student of Richard Karpen's at the Univ. of Washington, and have also a Bachelor's in Theory.  Electroacoutic is also an avenue I am eager to explore; Richard is a well-known composer of elecacous music, as well as a collaborator with colleagues on many software related issues.  I am currently studying Csound and Common Music with him.  I have only written a smattering of acoustic music, mostly for Film.  I am Premiering a concert piece for small ensemble here at the U at the end of February.  
The installation concept intrigues me, tell me more!  I'd love to hear/see a piece, if poss.

the band sounds very interesting.  I was in an experimental rock group for about five years, dropping that to study 'seriously' ;).  We put out one CD.  I have an album of my own material in the works for a small local label here, due out in June.  I would love to hear your band, and a more detailed description of how you work.

!!!  I would be interested if you are talking collaboration.  In this case, maybe we should get to know each other's work ethic and taste a bit better.  In the scramble to get my next piece together, I am sorry to say I have no tape to send.  I have a smattering of film cues from past projects, and some pop/hiphop tunes, but they won't give you an idea of what I'm really about.  Shall I send them anyway??  Very immediate, spontaneaous music, and not very 'serious'. :) 
	I would say about myself, as a composer, that I tend to go from a gut level feel of the gesture I want, then render that into notation.  I feel that, given my degree, I am most qualified to make some theory-ridden, empty mess and wish to apply the passion I've felt in rock and improvisatory situations to the page.  A difficult challenge, but one I am up to.  

Write back soon!

Hi y'all,

	I've talked to a few people one on one about the different tab issues from our recent, tabbed "Warner Masterworks". So... I thought I'd say a couple of things over again in email about the "Days of the New" tunes, so that everyone can tell me to stop repeating myself:

	If you don't have the style sheet I gave Gary (I think he gave everyone a copy), get it from him.  It has two systems of music and related text, and points out the new style manual text items.

	Lyrics, so far, are to be reduced to 24 point, for space's sake.  Use rastral five unless otherwise indicated.  Lemme know if anymore wants to arm wrestle about this.

	And a tip on getting your monstrosity through slot: center the guitar chord grids over the note the fall on.  This is done in lieu of separate, notated strumming patterns, so where the grids fall is important.  I screwed this one up big time.  Just ask Rick. :()

	Keep an eye out for a tuning indication in the upper left hand of page one of your tune.  If it's anything besides EADGBE, you will have to modify the tuni objects on the tab staff. Come and see Craig or myself on that note.

	We'll go over all this at the fabled "tab seminar", whenever it happens.  I thought these would be important points for anyone who begins a tab piece before then.
	..and last but not least, don't blame me - I didn't write 'em.  :) thanks and good day.

Hi all, 

	Another note for consistency's sake:  I've been using Acoustic Guitar Steel and Overdriven Guitar for clean and distorted guitar sounds, respectively.  Lemme know if you would rather use bird tweet or airplane and we can debate.

Hi,

Hi Everyone,

	If you're making/modifying a guitar chord, and you don't need a given dot or fingering (1-5, x, o), please DELETE THEM as opposed to making them invisible.  This makes playback easier to implement, which we, as forward-thinking individuals, must plan for.

Hi,

	Since there are now more than 2 lines, on average 3, for a warner copyright, could the title pages be updated so that there are more dummy copyright lines?  I wouldn't ask, but there is a bug that prevents one from duplicating text objects on the title pages right now.

Hi all,

	I'm compiling materials to use in training new folks.  Can you dig around on your boxes for anything you found useful while learning Solero, and send it my way?  Rick's document on swing feel is a great example of what I'm looking for.  In the coming week I'll be grilling you editors on your experiences during your first few weeks here, as well.  Thanks!

Nope, not yet.  I was gone this weekend, but my roommate said nothing came. I think we're talking a three-day wait for delivery, at best. :)  I'll let ya know when I get them, and your tape will go out tomorrow for sure.

Thanks!

Hi Art,

	First, thanks for an incredible show.  My girlfriend and I are longtime listeners.
	Second, I had a suggestion for a guest: Jerry Mander.  His brief bio and publisher info follows.  Incidentally, I copied this from
 
http://www.beacham.com/mander/mander_radio.html


"In Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television, Jerry Mander tore the happy face off of TV, subjecting its premises to the most exhaustive critical
analysis yet published. Then, In the Absence of the Sacred, Mander made the case that the utopian promises of technological society have proven false. Far
from leading to "technotopia," Mander shows how our immersion in a way of life emphasizing technology worship, economic expansion and commodity
accumulation has brought social disorder and global environmental devastation.

Most recently, in a series of essays he edited with Edward Goldstein (founder and publisher of The Ecologist), Mander helps us comprehend "the global
economy" and how it is affecting our lives. He urges that this global expansion be brought to a halt and reversed. "What we are being asked to believe is that
the development processes that have made people poorer and the planet more devastated will now lead to diametrically different and highly beneficial
outcomes, if only they can be accelerated and applied everywhere, freely, without restrictions..."



Books by Jerry Mander:

Four Arguments For The Elimination Of Television.
(New York: Quill, 1977)

In The Absence Of The Sacred: The Failure Of Technology 
and the Survival of the Indian Nations.
(San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1991)

The Case Against the Global Economy
(Edited with Edward Goldsmith)
(San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1996)

Thanks again!  We LOVE the show!  Way to support Francis Barwood!

PS:  Whatever happened to Al Bielek and the other Philadelphia Experiment people?

I have a meager list:
1) Frank Zappa "Serious Music": complete orchestral performance in Berkeley, CA by the Berkeley Symphony
2) FZ: complete World's Greatest Sinner Sountrack
3) FZ: Metal Man has won his wings: not the soundtrack but some sort of radio documentary of early zappa/moi period.  BBC?
4) Devo: Live in San Francisco
5) Devo: Live in Cleveland
	both are on the tour for the first record "Q:Are we not men.."
6) Nirvana: 1/2 hr Radio interview with Grohl and Novoselic on the eve of Nevermind's release
7) Beatles: The Beatles (white album): mono vers. featuring alt. mixes.
8) Beatles: White album outtakes
9) Score of FZ's Dog Breath Variations for Wind Ensemble

Sorry so meager.  I'm pretty busy writing my own stuff/practicing to pursue something so fun! :)  Lemme know if yer interested.

It's one side of a 100, so 45ish.  Anything else you want me to throw on the other side?  Let's see, this is quality using the x,vg,g,f etc, right?  I think vg- or g+..  I'm not too experienced at this.  It's obviously a dated recording, is mono (except fz's, voiceover), and is probably 3rd or 4th gen.  Pretty good, but I don't know how picky this scale is.  I know it was given to me as a 'vg', so help me out once you get it! :)  What's goin on the other side?  I've got quite a lot of rare modern classical (you name it, pretty much).

Yes I am.  Poor guy!  He REALLY sounds a bit out of it... I hear this is not 'creative' but due to an oncoming illness.  His difficulty at times was making me a bit upset, but of course he made me laugh too.  Thanks for providing that.  Did you get your tapes yet?

Whats up all.  I been down with the capt for only about a year now, but am blown away.  I'm a composer and guitar player/teacher, and have tabbed a few things from trout mask but not yet from other albums.  Any other (hey Slam buckra) players out there who emulate the man?  How about a way we can trim the fat (ads etc) from the messages posted to this group?  

Also, anyone who has music to trade: I'd love to get in contact with you!

Hi all,

	To my 'leaves':  Sorry if there's been a delay with your tapes.  My tape deck decided to die (actually, slow down to 3/4 orig. speed!  and no speed adjust inside!) last week, as luck would have it.  I borrowed a replacement from a kind friend last night, so if you haven't received anything yet, it's on the way.

	To everyone else:  Let's exchange trade lists.  Most of my 'leaves' didn't have lists goin, so I have alot of blanks now!  

Thanks,

	I picked up O solo Drumbo just recently, John French's solo record.  It is excellent.  All drums, no effects, mixed occording to drummer's perspective (hihat on the right etc).  Really nice rendition of "1010th day of the human totem pole", where he plays the drum part as well as Don's part on the drums.  I think he gets it, though it's a lot to listen for from a drum set!  Anyone else pick this up yet?

Sorry for my confusing last message!  I've been really swamped at the job, where I email.  I guess etiquette (I'm new to this too) states two blanks for one boot, or one for one.  Can you dub vid?  I'd love the cb video, otherwise please send me a tape of the pj stuff.  I'm more a fan of her earlier, stripped down stuff than her more recent produced work.  Thanks!

Hi Bill,

	I'm 25 and finishing up my undergrad at the U of W in Music Theory.  I am, however, debating about switching to composition, as composition is my main musical interest; the college I transfered from had no composition classes.  
	Stylistically, I'm still a novice, but lie between sound mass composers (Varese, Xenakis, Ligeti and Penderecki), and genre-manipulators found in the recent New York Avant-garde (Zorn, Sharp et al).  
	I am well versed in serial technique, having studied theory with Jonathan Bernard and, indirectly, John Rahn for the past two years. I don't think I'd go so as saying "I am a neo-serialist", though I am influenced by Webern's early work and some of the total organization ideas of Boulez and co.
	I look forward to the discussions!

Ben

Hi Brent, 

	I got this email from Mary McConney this morning about me being on monthly salary now, which I didn't think was going to happen for a little while.  Is there any way I can stay on every two weeks for a bit? Kind of unexpected. :)

Hi Brent,

	Two ?'s: 1) Where is it that I chnge the color of errors, bouncing ball, etc?  I'm not able to see my errors after checking/showing, and I can't get anything to become "invisible", either.
	2) Anyway to globally duplicate a setting for a mark or change settings (in the edit box) of a group of the same selected objects i.e. some marcato marks which I want to play at 150% volume?

Thanks,
Ben

Nevertheless, 150% DID make the attatched note louder than the surrounding notes!  Is this a bug?  :) I didn't think the box was in midi units (<=127), is it?

Hey Brent,

	The premiere was great!  About 100-150 people all cheering on our main character!  The films before and after my brothers were extra arty, so we had the comedic advantage in more ways than one.

Hi Brent,

	I am encountering a problem loading the Messiah viewer.  The auto-install won't install.  It encounters an error message "Solero Editor E005"?!?!  Anything I can do?  I haven't found any more bugs besides the ones we spoke of, by the way. It looks great!

Hi Brent, 

	Wasn't positive whether you were coming here tomorrow or I was going over there; I decided to assume the latter.  This formatter stuff is confusing!  Here are the 1st pass files - I hope we can get it up on the site by Sun. See you tomorrow.

I'll give you a ring tomorrow eve., after I've got the Chopin done (knock on wood) and maybe discuss another time for Mon?  OK, talk to ya later.

Hi Brent,

	If you remember my last amil, I think I said I wouldn't be able to meet tomorrow from 10 - 12..  I could meet at 5 tomorrow, but that will be it.  A few of my profs. are busy after tomorrow, I guess.  If not, wed. still works, or Tues., if need be. Sorry, but its the end of all things school right now, so I have to take what I can get.

Here is the corrected version of the tune, I think I may have sent you a previous version by mistake.  The whole note rests somehow got changed to half note rests in the entire piece.

Hi Brent,

	Gary came over and installed the printer this morning.  I went ahead and got to work on the Chopin text object issues, etc, and found that MY PRINTER PRINTS THE TEXT OBJECTS EXACTLY AS THEY APPEAR ONSCREEN.  So now what?

Ben

Oh yeah, I re-midi-rendered the piece and it plays fine.

Hi Brent,

	This is what I worked on almost ALL day Saturday.  It seems the formatter doesn't like all the grace notes.  We'll check it out today.

Hello everyone,

	I had a brief look at everything, and it all looks great!  I've had a couple of thoughts while I've been editing, and am noticing a few 'not so obvious' pairs of objects aren't being linked:

	Fingerings to their respective notes - I know sometimes this isn't practical or 		appropriate.  Wherever possible is fine.

	Pedal marks to the event list of the measure they fall in.

	Braces to Staves - Very important!

	When the formatter sees these unlinked, I think it assumes their free-floating text or something, and scatters them everywhere.  At any rate, it's part of the 1st pass process until the formatter wises up. ;)  Email me questions anytime.  Thanks.

Ben

Hi Brent,
	
	I've been gone lately!  Just got back from the obligatory time with the parents in Birch Bay (right by the US/Canada border).  This was fun for about three days, then grew torturous.

	I have Pink Panther from the Warners stuff, which I'll get done today.  Other than that, I've got a few music things goin on outside of work, so I'm busy and content.  
	Are you swamped because of the Warners thing or what?  See ya.

Hi Brent,

	The Warner piece went fairly quick (I think I logged 6 hours, but that included a little raid and phone time.)   I was to receive a Jewel tune from Glenda Friday, but I have no idea what happened there... I think she had to leave early or something.  Gimme another!

	Glad it looked good, it's good to hear.  Rick must get credit for the swing, though!  See ya.

So is that empty box with an arrow called a 'dropdown'?  I had (have) no clue.

That's fine, but not what I was talking about.  Remember when you were over last, and I showed you the dot collision at the top of some chords, because of where Solero draws the nut (thick horiz. line on top of chord)?  I'm asking if you want me to mess with those, or leave them.

Mariah Carey... sounds good.

The prob is this:

I've been exporting pages from a piece I'm working on in groups of 5 (page 1-5, 6-10 etc).  This saves time, because the file is 39 pages and takes forever to format/error check/song render/save.  The exported 'parcels' crash when I error check.  Two ?'s:

1) Log in raid? 

2) Is there an automatic bso-type command to split the 39 page file back into separate rms files, which I assume I will have to do?   The file, because of it's length, takes forever to export pages.

The reformatting (spreading 20 pages over 39 to get a smaller rastral number ie easier to read) Gary had the Tacoma folk do is holding things up (ok it's also more work for me!) I've worked on this thing for 4 hours now, and gotten nowhere. I've got 4 files like this, and they're all at the top of my priority list, all of the sudden.  While we're on the topic, what should the cutoff be again before I go on? 2 hours a page?  I can't remember...


Help,
Ben

Hi Brent,

	Remember those errors we talked about on the O'Morrison tunes?  Well, I haven't heard from Lorick yet on any but one, but they are almost all formatter errors.  Should I send them to Cam then?

Hey,

	Theres a repeat circled on a hard copy of this tune, which has no end repeat -- it just goes to the end of the tune.  Can you ask Warner how they want this done (ie where/what do we repeat)?  Thanks.

Hi Brent,

	Could you please check out bug #3687 when establishing the bug priority list Jill told me about?  It may not sound like an important one, but comes up VERY frequently with the Warner and guitar stuff.  I'd estimate that it would've shaved two hours of of my 16.5 I just spent doing a warner piece.  Thanks!

No, I haven't experienced this, but I did have to reset a few times to get the printer to realize I had added paper after running out.  This only happened once, however.

Hi Bruce, 

	I did read the web page, but neglected to notice the html publications at the bottom.  These will probably answer my questions.
	Kaija Saariaho is at www.goddard.edu/wgdr/kalvos/saariah.html.  Her music is very timbre-oriented, and she uses some generation techniques that are "computerish".  I think the web page discusses this.

Hi Cam,

	In regards to this bug, I found out, after reading some email from the 1st passer who edit this, that it probably was the recognizer's, then her doing.  The page was messed to begin with, then messed with more. :)

Hi Lorick,
	I got word from Brent to ask you to look at the following bugs; they're for HIGH priority tunes which need to get out pronto!  2586.rms  2629.rms

In case I didn't say anything in the bug, 2629 was built using the new song wizard, and 2586 was built from a barely recognized mrw.  Email or call me at 206-364-4651.  

Thanks!

Hi,

	In raid you said you had a format-complete copy of the rms file for the bug to send me.  Could you go ahead and send it?  I still can't get the file to format.  Thanks.

Hi Cam,

	I'm trying to reformat the file you formatted, under the title 2586b.rms. I want to spread it out along 3 pages, since the two pager doesn't allow room for the guitar chords I must now enter.  
	After inserting two page breaks, I have three pages with equal amounts of music!  The problem is, no matter how I space the systems out manually on the page, after formatting they are crowded at the upper half of the page. I have increased the min staff space, but it doesn't make any difference.  Help!

Hi Cam,

	Bug 2870 is the last (knock on wood) bug for the file formerly known as 2586.rms--one of these high priority tunes.  Everything looks good, I just can't get it to song render.  When you play it after rendering, it 'freezes' as opposed to crashing - I thought this was weird.  Thanks for your attention to this.

Hi Cam,

	Here is the skeletal version of the testing script.  Specifically, I haven't worked out test cases outright for formatting and playback, but have loaded older problematic files (early chopin, guitar stuff) and examined how the new build treats them.  Any input is welcome.

2142.rms is no prob. What happened is I got some server error sending you 2142.rms -- I didn't entirely understand it but I think they were saying they were out of disk space.  I didn't send anything called ACCFLOAT.RMS, maybe you could ask Brent?  Thanks.

No,  it's the distance between the rightmost accidental of the ksig and, if the first note of a system has an accidental, that accidental.  See attachment.

Hi,

	If I find bugs (the autolines are scattered on the page, the autohyphen isn't working in 'thousand mile road' and it crashes if I move some of the lyrics), do you want me to reply to you over email or log a new bug?  What is the state of the lyric wizard (ie are all the line/hyphen functions working?)?

	Thanks for all your help, it's coming along!

Hi,

	I'm running on a mac with 7.5.3 sys software.  I wonder if there is any intention to have it run with the older sys, or shall I assume I must upgrade to OS8?  I think, if upgrading is required, it would be useful to mention this in any review.  Incidentally, the fixes mentioned in 2.02 do not appear under 7.5.3.  I love the program, and use csound quite a bit for my own pieces as well as work, so I'm upgrading to os8 today!  
	Is this list the appropriate place for reporting bugs in the future?  If so, I am having trouble getting the last tutorial to function (the one with the tk_interface material) once entered and run through csound: the tk_interface opcodes are run directly to csound!  Thanks very much.

Hi George,

	Nice looking list!  Could you suggest a good, percussion-heavy Beefheart 
boot from your list?  My (meager) list.  Let me know if you want to trade anything else; I'd like a few of the beefheart you've got as well as the Syd Barrett.. :)

Cool.  By percussion-heavy, I mean that the drummer is clear and on a good night, basically.  The drums are usually my favorite aspect of Beefheart stuff..  I'll take that then, let me know what you want to do (if anything) about the rest.  Thanks.  Address?

I did just receive them Thursday, and while taping a few of the tapes one of my decks actually died!!!  No kidding.  :(  I'm retaping a few today, and will send tomorrow.  Sorry for the delay - I can't believe the coincidence (I don't do much trading or taping).  The Syd is great, I'll get to the Capt. today.  Let me know if you want to trade more, since I'll have my friend's deck for the rest of the week.

Hi George,

	Just sent out the tapes today, sorry again for the delay.  I think, in my haste, I may have neglected to mark the devo tape's info on the card.  If I did, here they are:

Side 1:
Devo: "He She or It's Devo!" Max's KC, 9/77
Tracks:
Get you ID
Those are Fools
Be Stiff
Praying Hands
Uncontrollable Urge
Blockhead
Smart Patrol
Mr. DNA
Sloppy

Too much paranoias

SIDE 2:
"Sing if you're glad to be DEVO"
Come Back Jonee
Blockhead
Too Much Paranoias
Praying Hands
Smart Patrol
Mr. DNA
Gut Feeling
Words get stuck in my mouth
Fanfare
"misc" : there are a few more on here, if I remember right, but that's all the card says...

Hope ya like 'em!

Jason's:

Jason Vontver grew up in Seattle. He began lip syncing to the band Boston
in his friend Michael's livingroom around age 10. Shortly thereafter he
began playing the drums which he now continues to do. Jason has enjoyed
performing with groups including the Young Composers Collective and the
Jack Brownlow Trio. He currently works as a freelance studio drummer and as
a music editor at Sunhawk Corporation. Jason and his wife Leslie live in
Fremont.


Lorick's:
Lorick started playing flute when he was 10 years old. In Victoria B.C., he 
met Eckart Seeber (an Austrian composer) and for about 6 years they jammed 
on Lorick's classical melodies. A few years later he joined an
african/reggae band called
Jambo Salama where he switched over to sax. He started his own band one
year later called 
DFUD which played improvised rock. He is now in the process of putting
another band together 
called Infant Factor  (A group of free jazz musicians).

and Paul's:

... well, I pestered and pestered, but it looks like he forgot to send it, and isn't picking up his phone right now!  Sorry, I busted 'em all and Lorick actually snapped and said 'alright alright shaddup!', so I tried my man.  He'll be here tomorrow morning and I'm sure he'll have it then (or else!).   See ya tomorrow.

Hi Chris,

	Good morning.  Looks like we're out of luck in using Paul/his equiptment; he has a gig at the puyallup fair the next day and there for must cram all of his work hours in on the 24th.  He was nice about it though ;)  I take it the SCO has no other resources?  Thanks for thinking of me on the performance.

Yeah, I gave him a call there a while ago.  I got the machine and left a message, but no response.  I kinda figured maybe they got back together or something, since he didn't call back... Hmmm..  OK I'll call.

I jes' ran into him at QFC. They're still getting the big D, but he's already moving in with another chick!   Call the lobotomist.  Next two weeks I should hear from him for a beer night.  In the meantime, check this shit out, baby:

Hi Craig,

	Check this out.  It's the original explanation of the lyric wizard tool.  It might prove helpful.
	Also, I think I told you to put the lyrics in before you format.  Now I think you should do it after... much easier.

Ben

>
>THE LYRIC WIZARD
>================
>
>Design Goals
>------------
>1) Make it easier to enter lyrics and assign them to notes
>2) Make the process of changing lyrics less error prone
>3) Automatically handle hyphenation and underlining in lyrics.
>
>Steps
>-----
>1) Text Entry
>2) Automatic Note Assignment
>3) Manual Note Assignment
>
>Step 1 - Text Entry
>-------------------
>
>Enter the entire line of lyrics as usual.  Use the hyphen (-) character to
>indicate where you would like to hyphenate between syllables.  These
>syllables will then be linked to different notes.  Use the underscore (_)
>character to indicate that you would like an underline to follow the text
>underneath all the notes the text is linked to.  Note that the underscore
>stuff isn't implemented just yet
>
>For example, suppose you type in the following:
>
>Oh I come from Al-a-bam-a with a Gui-tar on my knee
>
>It will assign the lyrics to notes as follows:
>
>*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
>Oh   I  come  from  Al - a - bam - a   with  a  Gui - tar  on    my  knee
>
>Or (once underlining is implemented), you could enter the following text:
>
>Glo_r-ia!  In ex-cel-sius de_-o
>
>It will look something like the following:
>
>*    ****   *  ****  *  ****  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *   *   *
>Glo____________________________ - ri - a!  In   ex - cel - sius de____ -o
>
>IMPORTANT NOTE:  When you use the "AutoHyphen" and "AutoUnderline" features,
>the hyphens and underlines will be adjusted automagically as you reposition
>or reformat the lyrics in the score.  The program will automagically add or
>remove extra hyphen characters as needed to fill out the space between lyrics.
>
>The way this all happens is determined by the Lyric Object Type.  When the
>type is set to "Trailing AutoHyphen Lyric" or "Trailing AutoLine Lyric", the
>- or _ character is only drawn as neccessary, and hyphens are added and
>removed when needed.  When hyphens are added, they are added as separate
>lyric objects with their object type set to "Hyphen Lyric".  Note that all
>this is done automagically by the program after you have entered the text.
>If you wanted to override this, you could change the object type from
>"Trailing AutoHyphen Lyric" back to "Normal Lyric".  In this case, the
>hyphen character will be drawn normally.
>
>Step 2 - Automatic Note Assignment
>----------------------------------
>
>Pick the starting note for the lyrics.  The program will then use space,
>hyphen (-) and underscore (_) characters to break the text into individual
>lyrics.  These lyrics will be created and automatically assigned to notes.
>
>IMPORTANT NOTE:  You should have a reasonably Song Render before you run the
>Lyric Wizard.  This will help it determine which notes to link the Lyrics to.
>
>Step 3 - Manual Note Assignment
>-------------------------------
>
>If the lyrics were improperly linked to notes after step 2, you can correct
>them in this stem.  Use the Next and Back buttons to select the lyric object
>you are working on.  The << Shift button will link the current lyric to the
>previous note.  It will also shift any other previous lyrics backwards to
>make room as necessary.  The Shift >> button will link the current lyric to
>the next note.  It will also shift any other following lyrics forwards to
>make room as necessary.  The Add >> button will keep the current lyric
>linked to its existing notes, but will link it to the next note also.  It
>will shift any other following lyrics forwards to make room as necessary
>
>Apart from these tools, you can also use the Back and Next buttons to select
>the current lyric, then use the normal CTRL+Click method to link and unlink
>a lyric from notes.
>
>The other tool worth mentioning is the Last Character scrollbar.  It isn't
>implemented yet, but it will allow you to override the way in which the
>program carved the text string into lyrics.  You can change the starting and
>ending position of each individual lyric using this tool.  If you try it,
>you'll see the highlight getting bigger and smaller as you move the scroll bar.
>
>Things to try
>-------------
>
>1) Create a new solo score
>2) Add some notes (at least 4, 8 is better)
>3) Bring up the Lyric wizard and enter "Old Su-san-na"
>4) Click on the first note in the Automatic Note Assignment.
>5) Try out the Shift and Add buttons and watch what happens
>6) Close the Lyric Wizard and drag some of the lyrics around.  Watch what
>happens to the hyphens.
>
>Well, thats my description.  It sounds a little tricky, but hopefully it is
>not.  The best thing to do is to try it out.  Please give me feedback on
>what you like/dislike about the new Lyric Wizard.
>
>Thanks

Hi everyone,

	I regularly receive reports on the Albanian situation from a friend of mine in Kosove.  I feel inclined to forward them to everyone I know.  If you don't wish to receive these emails, feel free to say so.  Thanks.

Hi Cam,

	I'll call you about this tomorrow afternoon, of that's good.  Any particular time after 12?

Thanks,

Ben



Hi,

Ben can you get in touch with Cam or visa versa - Cam's number is
(705)431-7340, Ben's number is (206) 364-4651.  There seems to be a
disproportionate number of lyrics related bugs coming from Ben that I think
are created because of a buggy lyrics tool and because it is being used
wrong.  We can at least correct the usage problems before the next build.

Thanks,
Brent.

I didn't consciously do anything with the file.  It seemed like an easy test for the formatter in the new build.  See, we are working out a script to test new builds, but at present it's a bit spotty.  So, to test the formatter, I have been going through quite a few finished files to see how much the formatter changes what the finisher did, thinking to myself that it would provide clear and easy feedback for ya.

What I don't understand is the talk about the copyright notices in the above, when it crashes when formatting the TOP sys on p. 2.  I think I'm missing something maybe, sorry if that's the case.  Is it crashing on the top sys because of the bottom?

Hi Cam,

	I did the things you said in regards to the ignore_vert_pos flag for the copyright text, and the top sys in 4045 still crashes.  Am I missing something here?  I hope I didn't, but I have to admit, you did lose me a bit in the last email.  Can you send me a file that won't crash, so I can see what you did?  Thanks.  I agree: having you here will save ALOT of time!

Hi Cam,

	Ok, here goes:

1) opened file, hit error check
2) hit error check.  The only errors that come up now are 'link between objs not bidir'  I click the error check options to get rid of these.
3) Now the log is empty
4) format top sys, p2.  *crash*

So, I went back, and before formatting:
3.5) set 'ignore vert pos' flag on all copyright text at bottom of p. 2
4) format top sys, p2.  *crash*

Should I have set this flag on every text obj?  It might be easier to disable this 'feature' and tweak whatever the formatter gives you sans text objects? :)  Lemme know if I'm clueless.

I will have to look things up, and there was a sale involved.  Also, I ordered these over the internet.  Is this an unreliable way to order??  I'd appreciate an explanation of what's up as opposed to a form email.  Thanks.

Frank Zappa: the lost episodes				150912
		you can't do that on stage anymore	130682
Pierre Boulez: works of edgar varese			413914

Thanks.

Hi,

	I just received my order, and I was charged 7.99 for single CD's, and 13.99 for double cds.  The offer distictly said 5.99 for singles, 7.99 for double cds, AS DID YOUR WEBPAGE.  Why am I not being charged appropriately?  
	Please correct the invoice, and bill me for the correct amount owed.

Thanks,

Thanks for your recent reply.  Will I be rebilled?  Please note I have already paid for 'Uncle Meat' in a previous shipment.

Thanks,

Man you didn't get it?  What happened?  Nobody's said anything to me...
No, I thought I said I'd be leaving this week for a brief vacation.  I've been trying to learn cecilia at home -- have you gotten this yet?  A lot better than having bbedit, cm, and csound open at the same time!  Check it out at the bath site if you can.  Bitchen program fer sure.
Next week I'll be at the U a bunch, pretty much for the sake of burning cds and finishing my piece, so I'm sure we'll hook up.  I'll be at night though.  Let's say tentative thurs, and I'll let ya know for sure when I get back (tues).  Tell me what's up on the job..

Let's say nine for the breakfast. Sound good?  Same place (Stoneway Cafe)?  Lookin forward to it.  The rehearsals are going fine, aside from the fact that everyone is flaky as hell.  I just found out (1.5 mos. into this fiasco!) that they're expecting to play my piece here on Sept 10, and in B'ham on the 12th!  And all my folks are doin this for free!  Anyway, it'll turn out fine, but it's a bit crazed now.  See you on Friday!

Hey,

So we don't get to hear it 'til December (next concert).  That's what's goin on with me.  Did Marv say anything to you about my frame.  The bike Center still has gotten no word from him...  See ya Mon.   Hopes it's all good.

Dan,

	Look, I was sincere in the message.  If you have the power to, please delete it.  There is nothing in the listserv docs, which I received when I joined the list, referring to this...  As I read I assume there is an 'unwritten' protocol, which only time teaches.  I'm really sorry, but think it's a little condescending of you to assume I know this.  If there was a communication to me regarding this, it was not received.  I reviewed the mails I received (six in all) regarding this, and there is nothing.  Sorry once again.

I'm copying this to the list so everyone knows I've been told.  Sorry everyone!

Dan,

Ok, no hard feelings I hope.  There was no intention of deviating from the subject.  I guess I neglected to mention in my post that SOMETHING made me associate the feeling I described with time.  Since you are one of the managers of the list, you must be knowledgeable about all things timewave..  Can you direct to any writings which may be related?  I'm really embarrassed about not knowing the protocol, but there isn't anything posted to you when you join the list.  Thanks!  

If want me to simply drop this I understand.

Thanks for the response,

	No 4-track, eh?  Perhaps you would make a dbx/dolby c copy of one such Dat, to 'start us off'?  My role is to get everyone's 2 cents into the mix, then mix to tape and get everyone a copy.  Interested?

Hi,

	I've got experience working with loops.  Can you give me a better idea of what you're after?  Influences, lyrics/anything else you wrote, etc.  Thanks.  Ignore the signature below; I'm at work! :(

Well, how 'bout this:  I've got a tape w/two goodies: 

FZ on SNL (which I discussed)
FZ at NY Palladium Halloween '81 (or 82, I forget which).  This is off of the USA Network when they first started.  My favorite is the KICKIN version of Alien Orifice.  If you have both these shows, I would love to trade both for both!

Hi,

	The problem stems from attempting to run the tk_interface tutorial example with the butterworth filters.  Using if..kgoto the ui created by the tk interface allows you to swtich between filter types (band-pass band-reject etc) and, via the breakpoint graph, allows you to control the center freq and bandwidth.  
	In the csound, there are opcodes which point to the values coming from this interface, prefaced with 'gk' (gkdata, gktype etc).   As I understand it, Cecilia is to replace these opcodes with appropriate csound, changing over time in the case of graphs.  In my brief experience, cecilia passes these 'gk-' opcodes directly to csound, which csound of course doesn't understand. 
	In the manual, the example ends with "Save the module, choose a sound with the file selector, define time-profiles with the graphs and press Play! "  By press play, I assume it means ctrl+space ie send to csound, correct?  Thanks.

Oooh boy, maybe another lollipop...

I clicked the signing computer and first got 'internet explorer is not your current browser, wanna make it so??' etc, then got 'couldn't locate your browser', even though it opened internet explorer.  Maybe because I run Netscape, but still seemed odd.

Ok, this one gets the lollipop:

last message was from the viewer on malibu, but this time I went to the site, downloaded, installed, then tried to get on the site with the singing computer.  
Nothin.  Not a thing. I already had netscape open, by the way.

oooh, one more:

I already had a copy of the viewer open, and when I downloaded a tune from the site, it opened another copy of the viewer.  Not a big deal, but I thought you might want to know.

You betcha..

Do you feel ok swapping addresses?  Here's mine:

7825 11th Ave. NE
Seattle, WA 98115

Only problem is, this is going to change in about two weeks...  Unless you want to send something now, let's start this in two weeks.  Cool?  Branca is the man, by the way.  Nels Cline I've heard, but not Vinny Golia.  Tell me somethin'.  Thanks for the reply.

Hey,

	Sorry AGAIN about the lag.  I had troubles getting my new place setup, and school just started.  I found another person to participate; here is what we said.  I'll send a tape by Wednesday (4track hasn't gotten here yet!!@%^#$!^%$!)

I had written it down, but don't know where that is now, either!  Anyway, I'll have to make another tape I guess...  You really didn't get it?  Bummer..  Well, I can do better this time anyway! :)  See ya

Hi,

Delusions and Lies! 
I don't read code (not a programmer except for a few obscure, music-related languages), so I can't really follow your email.  It would be easier, also, to respond to each bug directly back to me in RAID, if you can. Thanks!

Boy, I'm still new at this trading stuff.  My list is attached.  I'd like to know a bit about the beefheart boots.  If you should like the stuff I've got, maybe we could go for the "greatest boots", otherwise could you suggest?  I like John French especially, but other than like it all!  Hope to hear from you soon.

Hi Dimitri,

	There are few performance-related markings here (bowings, etc) and the meter isn't clear in the playback.  There are also a few typographical errors that I need to clean up.  Other than that, I think it's done!  Let me know what you think.
	Oh yeah!  It's in build 108.

Hi Dimitri,

This is done by entering the "other commands" section BEFORE you enter email, right when you log onto dante (or homer or whatever).  There is a section for email forwarding there, which is fairly straight-forward.

"some important" doesn't sound quite right, I think "by such prominent Brazilian orchestras" is better.  'Some important' sounds like they have a name, but may or may not be able to play!  :)  Prominent is in praise of WELL-EARNED stature.

Maybe you want to say 'revised edition of the original score' or 'revision of the original score'?  You could simply say, 'This is a revised edition."  You have a bit of flexibility here.  

Good to hear from you; hope the quarter and summer go well.  I'm sure I'll see you soon.

Hi Dimitri,

	Here it goes.  Remember-you need netscape!  Hope the summer is going well.  I've been playing with a few people from the young composer's collective, playing some jazz - really fun!  Have you been playing at all, or is it mostly writing these days?

Ben

PS: Do you have winzip?  Why couldn't you unzip this?  Let me know how I can help.

If you have winzip, you simply open the archive and the winzip program will open.  If not, I can email winzip, but make sure -- it's 3megs!  See you soon.

Dimirti,

Dimitri,

	Sorry, but I don't have Finale on this computer.  It is on the Mac, and doesn't work well; it is an old version with no enigma file save.  Do you know Donald Craig?  He's a student of Joel's also.  I know he has a recent version of Finale, but don't know if he has a modem.  I don't have his email or phone #, but maybe Joel does?  Sorry I can't help more.

Thanks!   I'm glad you guys could come out.  The performance was incredibly sloppy, unfortunately.  I think everyone was a little overwhelmed by the surroundings, large screen, etc., so I couldn't get anyone's attention!  this is why the tune at the end didn't come through; it sounded simply like we were improvising...  Next time!

didn't we look at this before?  I think 'important Brazilian Orchestras' is too simplistic, like saying 'really great brazilian orchestras' ;) I can't think of another word that could replace it -- it might be better to leave 'important' out, but it's up to you.

Bis was written to be performed as AN encore.  The piece is funny, in a jazzy style.  The violin part requires ??? I'm not sure what you mean here: 'brilliant'.  Does that mean the player must express what's in the score impeccabably, or is it a challenging part?  Write back.

Definitely.  This is one of the most difficult situations to conduct in, so the cues, particularly in the trial scene at the end, weren't always noticed by my players!  Oh well. I also only wrote and rehearsed this in 2 days!  I think my material was OK, but this was nowhere near enough time to rehearse.

This ^^^^ is good, but 'brilliant' technique is not quite right.  When someone says 'brilliant', especially in music, it refers to something intellectual, ie 'Dimitri is a brilliant composer'.  If you were to say 'he is a brilliant player', you would be saying he can really SEE the composers intent within the notation and bring it out -- quite different from what you want to say.  Is 'virtuosic' (virtuoso) to strong?  Perhaps '...requires from the player precise technique...".  I think I like that bettter.

Oh yes, why 'bis'?  Is this the german word bis?  Or portugese maybe?

The simple answer is that you can't.  You zip it and that's as small as it can get.  .raw files are a good example of a file that you can't zip;  you can run it through the zip program but it doesn't get any smaller.  Zip can't always shrink a file; text and executable file shrink great, but data files usually don't.  It sounds like you know how to use the program fine. Sorry!

As far as I know, you simply open it and the conversion takes place.  To display in the open dialogue, go below the displayed files, and it will say 'show: Solero files (*.rms)' or something similar.  You can change this to show all files.

I agree with you.  This is something I've been putting off.  In my opinion, this (the opening and closing material) is the weakest material in the composition, but must remain in some form to balance the middle.  It's a problem I haven't yet solved.

Good call.  I didn't catch that, and neither did Heather! (She also plays Viola)

I've heard this both ways, and Karpen suggested I leave the arco in for the sake of clarity.  I, being a string player, always assume arco as well.  The newer scores I have read, particularly in the Wind Ensemble, always specify, so I am also following convention there.

	This is specifically what I wanted your opinion on.  Alot of scores I've read use the 4/4+7/8 thing, and a few texts (David Cope, in particular) suggest it as well.  You think 15/8 eh?  I agree because the 1/8-note pulse is to be felt throughout (makes it much easier to play), but I'm advised by Karpen to leave the 4/4+7/8, and have a dotted barline between the 4/4 and 7/8 bars.  
	My main concern is ease of reading and rehearsal. I wrote a piece with an intricate 11/8 part a while back, which confused everyone (except me!).  :)  So what to do!  I think I will re-write '15/8 (8/8+7/8)', with the dotted barline, and everyone will be happy.

I think it's confusing that you have 'clarinets in Bb..Horns in F..etc' but then have the notice at the bottom.  I would assume you mean the instrument in that key is used, but notated in C, right?  I would say 'Horns, Bb Clarinets, etc' since the notice says in what key they are notated.  
	Let me say it another way.  In my experience, when something says 'nnnn in x' (nnnn=instrument, x=key), I assume a transposing notation, but 'x nnnn' only identifies the instrument.  Therefore, something like 'Clarinets in Bb', paired with your notice at the bottom of the page, is confusing; 'trumpets in C' paired with your notice is redundant.  Clear?  I hope so.
	For what it's worth, I usually see 'tympani', and not 'tympano'.  Portugese or my ignorance?  See you soon.

Hi Dimitri,

	I am fine, thanks.  The primary focuses (foci?) of the meeting were slot-finisher relations and some details related to the new office.  In general, people are not following true 'house style', according to the latest style sheet and the new checklists we are receiving here.  I am wondering if you chould even worry about it...  :)  Talk to me Friday at comp lab and I'll give you the basics.  I think it was mostly office-specific, to be honest.

Hi,

	Maybe you remember seeing me around 268 the last few quarters.  I'm a composition student and need a percussionist for a piece of mine, to be played on May 21st (ProConArt).  Available?? I want to get three rehearsals in.  Your help would be very appreciated.  Thanks and feel free to call!

Well, it's all up in the air right now.  Here's the story:

This group of composer's and performers from Western and the U organized themselves under the name 'Contemporary Chamber composers and performers", and asked me to submit a piece.  So I give them a piece, for which I provide three extra players, and everything's fine initially.  There's to be a concert in both Seattle and B'ham, and I'm on the Seattle one only.  Last week, one of the organizers asked me if he could get a ride with me to the B'ham concert, which I of course didn't know I was to play at.  So, to make a long story short (too late?), I need to find a sub for Paul for a B'ham concert.  I thought of you and wanted to touch base, but I found out last night that this was a false alarm! So, Thanks for replying, and I'd like you to play on this for proconart this fall, but don't need ya now, I THINK!  :)  How's everything going?  Good summer so far?  Are you back in town now?  Good to hear from you and take care.

Hi Emmy!

	I was wondering if you could help me out.  The group that played my piece (CCCP) has the opportunity to play again at the Benaroya Hall as part of some lunchtime concert series.  We're unsure how we're goin to get ahold of the percussion equiptment for the place; Greg felt we wouldn't get it if we asked UW.  So... I thought I'd see if there was anyway you could help.

	Here are the details: the performance is 9/24 (thurs) 12-12:45pm. We'd need the following equiptment:

	Three toms
	Brake Drum
	Two Crash Cymbals
	Two Rides
	Two Triangles 
	Brake Drum
	Snare
	Wood Blocks
	Vibraphone
	...and one or two tympani (Chris is getting back to me on this one)

	Is this in the realm of possibility?  We'd prbably need an hour before and after the concert for travel/load time.  Thanks so much!
	Also, to reiterate our last conversation, I would love you to play on the piece for the fall proconart.  Let me know when you'll be around Friday, first week of school, and I'll show you a part.  The Concert, according to the events calendar on the web, is Monday, Nov. 30 in Meany!  Lemme know. 

Talk to you soon,

Hi everyone,

	I thought I might pass it on that I've discovered that grace notes linked to notes across a bar line cause the formatter to crash.  Figuring this out helped me save many 'hopeless' pages.  Hope it helps.

Hi Everyone,

I'm editing some of the Art of Fugue (four staves per system), and am having trouble maintaining correct page dimensions.  I'm using 87, since later versions refuse to play anything I've edited, so far.  It goes like this: I save the pages and join them via bso, then reopen.  The page's dimensions have shrunk because of a familiar 87 bug, so I attempt to remedy with bso -mg:1000 xxxxx.rms.  (3000, the value I usually use, leaves too much of a margin) This doesn't completely fix the problem; the vertical dimensions are fine, but it appears that the file has been vertically compressed by a factor of, maybe, 10000.  Any help out there?

Sorry, it was early when I wrote that.  The files were fine vertically, but HORIZONTALLY compressed.  :)

Hello everyone,

	I have a few files that have been crashing on me.  These files have worked fine up until the point at which I add the copyright, header and page #; after this they crash.  When I add the copyright object, I do so by cutting the thing directly from the style document Gary sent out a while ago, which I assumed was how everyone did it.  Could this be the cause of my woes?

Can we use 103 to finish pieces for posting to the website?  In other words, is there a v103 viewer on the website?

	Sometimes when I sttempt to re-install the editor, particularly after a crash, I encounter an error: "error install rms.dll".  When I try to trash the entire program folder currently installed, it says there has been a sharing violation and that the file may be in use.  Could one of the programmers explain why this occurs and whether or not we can re-install without having to restart?  It would save some time...

Hi Everyone,

	Please excuse this bit of self-promotion.  I am performing music I composed to Cecil B. Demille's 1916 (I think) Paramount silent film "The Cheat" on Sunday, July 6, from 11:00pm-11:45pm, and would love anyone in the Seattle area to stop by. 	It's at the Grand Illusion, on the corner of 50th and University Ave. in the University District.  Admission is $6.  Thanks.

	Looking at the past 20 or so bugs in Raid, I can see I'm not the only one having difficulty attaching the coyright notice to finished pages.  I am under the impression that no one can get 102 to attach copyrights...am I right?  Seeing that the copyright text in unenterable in the edit box of a 102 text object, and that finished material in 103 is unpublishable (if that's a word) on the web, the latest version usable for editors is 100, right?  I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

	In build 100, in the text edit box, there is a font button with '#n' on it, depending on which font was last used.  Is there any way to change this with a key, instead of clicking on the button  and finding the font? (what a lazy butt!)  I am so used to tabbing to the window and hitting t twice for times new roman.  ???

How do you use touchup ties/slurs, and can we configure the t/s distance (it appears we can, but doesn't work) in the layout settings window?  This is in build 104c.

Hi all, 	

	I just a few words about the new build for the programmers.  I began entering one of my pieces last night, and had some questions and comments.
	First, the new dialogue that pops up when hitting 'new score' looks great.  Is it fully functional yet? I've always been advised to use the plumbing tool instead, and wonder if that still holds.  The formatter didn't pick up certain things, particularly time sigs (I logged all this in raid); is there a bug we're aware of using multiple time sigs -- eg a bar of 3/4, then 2/4, then 5/4, then 4/4 etc?  
	Cut copy and paste work great now; a few builds back they sometimes produced errors in formatting. This made everything SO much easier!   Good job!

Hi Erica,

	I hope everything is OK with these.  There was no one here to ask questions to regarding layout issues except Jessica, for a short while.  Basically, I didn't know whether to put the copyright notice on every page or just the first.  I'll be gone next week until Friday, but will be in Saturday if you need me to answer anything.  Thanks!

Hi Erica and Gary,

	Since I had to finish this file before I leave for Arizona, I went ahead and 'hand formatted' this one.  I haven't encountered a layout like this, but this is how it came to me.  FYI: I had to section each line to get correct playback, and couldn't magnify my view any farther than 'zoom to width'. I hope this works, but you (Gary) might want to take a look for future reference.
	Oh yeah, one more thing: the user must select 'landscape' in print setup to have it print this correctly.  How can we default this for this page?
	See you next weekend.  Have a good Thanksgiving.

Hi Erica,

	Ok, there are a few issues with this one which I forgot to include in the last email.  If you check the raw out, there are apparent 'errors' which I changed and listed on the last page of the bullseye packet or whatever the .... we are calling this thing.  Tell me what you think of the tempo at the end; I thought the double bar at the top of the last page would mean a 'tempo I' mark and a return to quarter=88.  Go ahead and change it if you think so; I left it.  thanks!

Hi Erica,

	Here is the big email to hopefully clear up all of the confusion about the guitar pieces.  There are a few confusing issues, due partly to program error and partly to the crowded nature of the music.  Please keep these things in mind before you get frustrated with anybody.  :)

	1)	The raw we are using is ANCIENT, and rife with error.  I'm the only step between the book and the subslot; I have to hand enter, finger, correct (alot of that here) and then recheck.  I'm sure you can relate to the burnout potential here; remember the christian music of late?  :)  So, there are definitely going to be mistakes.  I'm sorry. :'(
	
	1a)	To underline the error/burnout issue: this is my first time entering this stuff, and I'm making a lot of mistakes.  Sorry!  Sorry Craig!

	1b)	Also, since the raws are ANCIENT, I took some liberty with things like stem angles.  I think the way the stems are in most of these pieces are indicative of what usually goes on in guitar notation.  I know it's different, and I feel like I tried to warn everyone at the meeting in which I gave my 'seminar', but I guess it didn't take.  (why am I not surprised??  :)  So, I'm leaving a lot of these that you circled.  Please see the individual documents, and please trust me.

	2)	The tab code in the editor is REALLY buggy.  This last build is the first time it's been given any kind of priority since like 104d!  There are a lot of bugs which, per Brent, Judy, Marlin, and me, we are going to live with.  These include:

		- inconsistent tab numbers: the font is bold or not bold at random times.  I can't find a pattern to it.  We can't fix it unless we go through each number right now to check, since eyeballing is too 'iffy'.  So, we leave these.
		- tab numbers lighting up at the wrong time: I can't remember if you or Craig brought this one up, but it's a bug and we're going to publish despite it.

		- the formatter does weird things when tab is there.  I can't be much more specific than this, but it's to blame for some of the things you pointed out.  Please keep this in mind.

	3)	On many of these, you say to put 'guitar solo' at the beginning of the piece.  When you asked me about this last week, I said I have never seen it this way in any other publication, and suggested we didn't put it there.


	I'm trying not to be defensive, and hope I'm succeeding.  I really missed some simplicities in these and I'll get better at it as I keep entering these by hand.  I have to say, though, that I read a little condescension in the notes to me and Craig about this, which I can't imagine is intentional.  If someone asked me, "how 'bout that Erica?" I could only say, "She loves me.  She loves us all!  She comes in at 5am shouting 'Go Sunhawk!' at the top of her lungs daily!"  
	
	Ok you get the point.  Let's talk about these and get 'em up tomorrow, ok?  It's a high priority according to Brent and Judy, and I've been given permission to call some shots as far as these go.  "push them through" was the original wording, I think.  I grabbed all of the Sor pieces off of your desk and will fix everything tonight.  See ya tomorrow!

Your buddy and pal,

Hi all,

	Ian has a great point about replying to messages via the list; I think we should try to stick by this so everyone benefits.

	Ian: I'm a bit inexperienced with lyrics, but I believe you have to add the extension lines manually via the graphics/line option on the right click menu.  I couldn't find anything in the lyric wizard.

Hi all and welcome back Gary,

	Shall I raid these problems w/106?

	1) Text in edit boxes is remove and replaced with 'insert text here' when the font is changed.

	2) 106 editor doesn't turn pages on my files, regardless of whether they were built in 106 or prior.

	...and a question:  I've got a Bach Art of Fugue in which the fugue and its inversion are presented on the same system.  Gary and Rick have proposed I create a single file in which both could be played separately, but I'm unsure if/how we could do that.  Suggestions?

Hi,

	Could we please review the page format for the Warner stuff, in light of our recent score style changes (eg title at 60 pt in rastral 4, etc). Specifically: page numbers, copyright placement, title page.  Also: if there is an arranger, do we put "arranged by Xerxes Xynen", or does the reader assume that the guy underneath the composer (no offense to you arrangers ;) is the arranger.  Ditto for Lyricist.

Hi,

	I justr received my first batch of WB fake book tunes.  I'm implementing all the line stuff for the copyright notice sent on 10/31, but I'm wondering where we get the initial copyright text (top two lines).  Do I use what's on the raws?  Sorry if I'm making anyone repeat themselves.  :)

Sorry for all these questions!!!  

There's nothing on my example title page referring to a musical example.  And these ARE the ones you sent on 10/31.

..So where does it go?

Don't shoot me ok?...

Has anyone been able to get playback after pasting the excerpt on the title page of one of these WB tunes?  I can't get it to song render.  Gary: I'll hold off sending you the file until I can rectify this.

Hi Ben,

Yeah, its kinds klugy, here's how.  Lorick, can you make it so all you need
to do is click on the page icon and hit delete - then blow away all the
objects on that page and nuke the page object.

To delete a page, move to the page you want to delete.  Hold down CNTL and
SHIFT and sweep out a rectangle on all the objects on the page and hit
delete.  Double click on the page icon (number in the left hand toolbar
with the voice and instrument icons).  Move to another page.  Now hit the
delete button on the dialog that came up when you double clicked on the
page icon.

Thanks,
Brent.

Hi everyone, 

	There is an error message in regards to endos which reads 'endo is linked to event lists which play at different times'.  Is there something I'm missing here?  At least 50% of the endos in the files we get go over the barline, right?

Hey y'all,

	I noticed this week that a lot of people don't use/don't know how to use the i-let tool for tuplets of more than 9 notes.  The thing is a little confusing, but pretty useful after you get the hang of it.

	Here's whatcha do:  Say you want 11 eighth-notes in the space of 8 eighth notes.  You would make an i-let from the right-click menu, and double-click it.  In the edit box, enter 11 for the value.  Now the confusing part.  The numerator is the number of notes that SHOULD be there, in our case 8.  The denominator is the number of notes you WANT TO fit there, in our case 11.  This beats the ---- out of entering the durations manually.  If you're still unclear about this object, feel free to ask.

Hi all, 

	It would be helpful if people could paper clip, rather than staple, the printouts to their finished pieces.  This way, those slotting/subslotting don't have to rip the pages apart.  It's nitpicky, but if we pass these things back and forth a few times, it could get messy if stapled.

Hi,

	Lorick wanted me to let you know that the error check works a bit differently now (117e).  Basically, as soon as the error check stops as soon as it encounters a 'showstopper' error (red dot in error log).  Fix this, and re-check.  More errors, possibly another showstopper could creep up. The point of this method is to prevent the overlap of showstopper bugs from crashing the editor.  (did I get that right Lorick?) It's a bit different than what I'm used to with 106d.

Hi everyone,

	This is from Lorick (his email isn't working yet), in regards to 117h:

	117h contains new errors in the error log which didn't appear in 117g, so the viewer we currently use, 301b, won't recognize them.  The workaround for this is to perform tools>error remove>all before doing your final save.

Yep,  I've got two:

if you have 'extra-lyric' elements in a lyric i.e. '2.' for second verse, and there is nothing to attach said lyric to:
1) Format system before using lyric wizard
2) add an extra note where you want the element to be
3) use the l.w. and attach it!  Delete it when you're done.

Also, I'd suggest using the extension lines in the l.w. like we do in 118w, even though the lines are just too dang long.  It's pretty useful if you have one lyric per sys, but what about multi-lyric systems (tm) that all end in extension lines?

1) Wiggle (ctrl+left, ctrl+right) the Lyrics with the ext lines, so that the lines appear.
2) adjust ONE of the ext lines the way you want it, and open it's edit box
3) copy the x value for the right point in the box
4) Paste it in the same spot in the edit boxes of any extension lines you want to align with it.  Yes, I am the run-on sentence king.

That's all I can think of now... :)

That is, sometimes you encounter a melodic or harmonic element in a certain change (or sequence of changes) in orchestration (aka instrumentation here) and vice versa.  
>	What I'm saying here, and in not answering the question I hope to emphasize the point, is that the asian music plays a dual role, orchestration and counterpoint.  The music is really low in the mix, and blurs the line between the previous scene (floating above the bed) and the oncoming closure.  So in this sense, it plays a literal orchestrational role: a blurry, ethereal sound, barely in the mix, seems to recall the previous scene while existing literally in the scene (it's coming from a's stereo in his bedroom).  
>	This isn't the only way to read it, though, since Japan/Zen/etc is a powerful symbol in the movie.  It's a literal counterpoint in this sense, since the imminent closure will reduce A's life to a zen-like simplicity (which he strives for?) and that it has crept into the soundtrack at key times previously, thereby linking it to those.  
>	I think tark is really a composer at heart;  he does everything in such an overtly musical way it's easier to link him to composer's stylistically rather than other filmmakers (for me, at least).  What music do you listen to?  Are the music references making sense?

Sir, honored to receive a mail from you. ;)

You'll likely see my reply to Keith, but I'll add a bit. I've been doing sound design with a colorful array of programming tools (Csound and Common Music, if you're hip to that) and can manipulate sound in a variety of ways.  This kind of thing is very conducive (sp?) to game/fantasy/sci-fi settings.  My experience so far is applying these skills to film and within my own compositions. 
	You know how usually we lower the pitch of a sound by slowing it down?  We've all (probably) taken a record and played it back at a slower speed, only to hear the words garbled by how low the voice now appears. With techniques I've learned we can make the sound play at half speed,   ( or 1/4 or 1/8th or whatever) without changing the pitch.  Or move there gradually through normal playback.
	Maybe more than you needed to know?  I write "real" music too, but thought this might be a good opportunity to flex my new muscles!  We could read through your mouth-didg, pick out a .01 sec section of it and layer that to create a new instrument... whoops tangient.  You get the idea though.  Read my reply to keith and lemme know if you're still interested.  Thanks a lot for the reply!

Gary,

	I received the downloads without problem.  In the file Chno_32, there are some conventions and details I was wondering about:

	1) there are curved lines over the 3s in the left-had triplet figure of the first measure.  Is this a phrasing thing (slur the triplet, accenting the rhythm) or a notational convention (separating it from the crescendo above)?

	2) The scan is a bit slanted.  The staff lines on solero deviate nearly 1/3rd the distance between the lines on the original staff by the end of a system.  (Boy that was wordy)  I assume we ignore this and concentrate on the solero notation, using the orig. as a guide?

	3) The fingerings and pedal markings are smaller than in the original.  Do (or can) I change this?

	I've a few more questions.  Could you give me a call when you get this?  I will be home (525-8612) until 2:30.  Thanks!

Hi Gary,

	I've been really sick the past couple days and read right past the thing in your message about the one raw file!  Sorry!

	Sorry about the glitch thurs.  It's finals week at school and everything's a little harried.  Freedom awaits next week!

	By the way, I sent the emails to all my 1st passers.  One asked if she should be sending things directly to me yet, and I told her to give them to you first, since you send me something of Margaret's.  Is this correct?

Hi Gary,

	Take I-5 to the Lake City Way exit.  At the first light, take a left, onto 80th.  Then take a left on 11th, the street before the light, which is on Roosevelt.  Ours is the fifth or sixth house on the right, white with red trim.  The address is 7825 11th Ave. NE.  If there are any problems, my # is 525-8612.  Thanks and see you in the morning.

Hi Gary,

	Here is the finished nocturne.  There had been a bit of confusion as to placement of the text objects; Brent said they moved a bit when printed.  On my printer, however, they do not, so after moving them for Brent's printer, I've moved them back.  Let me know if everythings OK.  Thanks.

Hi Gary,

	Here is the revised (again!) version of the Nocturne.  Some answers, and some questions:

>First of all, did you get a copy of the finish check list and
>the Style sheet for titles, headers, footers and the like?

Yes, I did.  Sorry for the oversights.

>(4) There are a couple of "5" fingering marks on page 1 that may not be
>	in the right places. Please recheck and fix if necessary.

Is it Solero style to have the fingering DIRECTLY underneath the note it affects?  This isn't always the case in the original; the fingering may be to the side of the note to avoid collision with the pedal mark, neighboring note, etc.  I think you were referring to the floating 5 in the 4th system on p. 1 -- it was hiding behind an event list!  This is fixed, and I didn't see any others.

>(6) Page 2, end of system 2.
>	Can you shorten that last measure that contains only the 3/4
>	time sig change info.?

Let me know if you want me to spend more time evening this system out.. it takes a bit to scoot everything around in relation to the shortening of the last bar.

>(9) I'm no Chopin guy, but could you recheck the note pitches and
>	accidental linkages on page 4, last measure of system 4 and

A cloudy spot on the orig. that I didn't catch... Thanks!

What is the stance on those triplet numbers with the slur over them? See the raw file attached.  Margaret put these in her file (all over the place), so I will assume you want them out since it wasn't addressed.  Let me know.

The braces on the original are much more 'curvy' or 'flamboyant' than ours, and I kind of like that -- whats the house rule?

Let me know when we can get together next week.  I have lots of these little questions.  :)  Thanks

Hi Gary,

	How's this one?  I assume, from your detail-work on my score, that I should take the time to check the notes and marks against the original?  I can see how much has been overlooked.  :)

Ben

PS I'll talk to you in the morning re: the Berceuse which Margaret 1st-passed.  Some tricky things that I had to hand format; the formatter couldn't handle all the grace notes!  Give me a good time after ten tomorrow (I'll be done by then).

Hi Gary,

	You should be happier with this one.  I tweaked everything I could.  what do you think of the 1st bar, last system, page 2?  This one is the only toughie.  I'll send the Berceuse along in a few hours -- I'm having problem assembling everything into one file!

Hi Gary,

	Here's what I sent Miriam.  She sent me the .raw file for 03, but apparently lack 04.  (?)  If you could send me that, it would be appreciated.
Also, let me know how I should prioritize the CD's contents in the case that I finish what's been sent my way.
	Also, Margaret edited some Art of Fugue stuff (and I thought I had served my time in Music 313!), so that is to follow this Verdi stuff Miriam sent.
	Also also, perhaps it would save time/confusion to write up a 'guide to wiring things up to MIDI' for the 1st passers?  I'm spending much of my time fixing playback issues.

Thanks,

On page 3 it seems you were a little confused about what notes belonged to which triplet, which voice gets what notes, etc.  I attached an annotated (sp?) page 3, showing how we can fix these things.  Does this help?  Lemme know.  You will want to load your original in the editor as well and see exactly what I changed (especially the voice icon stuff) I think.  I hope it helps.  Everything looks great and is quick to layout - these are confusing little things that trip me up too.  Talk to you soon!

Hi Gary,

	The playback on this file is BUGGY!  I need you to send me the berceuse I sent you.  Solero did something weird with this one, maybe even during recognizing, that is giving us weird things like a 'grace flag' on a crescendo (that one took me forever to find!).  I've been working on it for about an hour, but I'm not sure if I've done more damage now than was done to begin with.

Thanks,

Ben

Hi Gary,

	I got a batch of stuff from Jayne, like the attatched page.  Shall I put a title and composer on it or is it part of a collection?

	The Berceuse is causing enormous difficulty during playback, as is one of the files Miriam sent.  I have them all edited and playing at some point, but that isn't the case later.  :(  Have a good weekend.

Hi Gary,

	I thought I'd consolidate all the files I'm working on in one discussion.


(My responses start with '--')
Aida Notes (File: Aida1.rms)

General: Run format stems.
Format stems (through build 87 at least) has to be run separately
from format pages. The code for it didn't get folded into format pages.
Lots of stems are off.

--Thanks.  This is the first I've heard of that.

Page 1, system 1, top staff, last measure - recheck the grace note
duration/link.

Page 1, system 4, bottom staff, first measure - must be a wrong pitch on the
	grace note. Probably to be lowered by a degree as the graces in
	the previous measure.

Page 2, system 3, bottom staff, measure 1
	The slur collides with the flat sign
--re: these three comments: This is the way things appear in the original.  I fixed the slur, but that was how it originally appeared.  

Page 3, system 4, top staff, measure 2
	Should be octave C's, but there is lower C
	with B-flat above.
--Fixed.

Page 3, systems 4 and 5
	The arpeggio segments are still set as trills!
	Double click on the wavy lines,
	and set their type to arpeggio segments
--Fixed.

Page 3, system 5, top staff, measure 1
	Another octave problem - last beat
	middle of the triplet octaves - you have
	a D below with an E above -- should be
	2 D's udoubtedly
--Fixed.

After midi rendering, load all your songs in the score viewer
and listen to them at reduced tempos. These acoustic problems
will be easier to find and correct then.
--Thanks...this helps.

*************************************************************

On verdi2.rms

(1) Needs header on page 2
--Already there.

(2) Arpeggio segments are still set to trill!
Change to arpeggios!
--Ok.

(3) Run format stems.
--Ok.

(4) Check pitches again on page 2, last system.
--Pitches seem fine to me against original and my ear.  I'm wondering if I somethings getting corrupt during file transfer?  The lack of a header on p.2 leads me to this conclusion, since I had it there.  Weird.

***************************************************************

Notes on balfe1.rms

(1) Check pitches on page 1, system 4, measure 1
--Fixed.

(2) Fix arpeggio segments that are still set to trills (page 2)
--Fixed.


(3) Learn to wire values for the fermatas - page 2
Double click on the fermata and set its duration to something acceptable -
interpretation allowed here of course.
A quarter note = 384 midi ticks. 
Remember that time in all measures of a system must be equal, so if you 
set a fermata in top staff of 192, you must have a fermata in bottom 
staff also set to 192.
The value in the fermata duration field is the amount of time ADDED to
whatever note the fermata is attached to.
Fermatas get linked to the measure icons and the notes they modify.
--Ok.  I MIDI rendered this and played it back a million times to quadruple check, so it should work!  Tell me if you think I should change anything - it might still be a little quick.  It's pretty subjective, I suppose.

(4) For the sub-title, use typographical quotes (curvy quotes), not the
straight ones. (Alt+0147 and Alt+0148)
--Ok.  Are there any other alt+nnnn things I should know about?


****************************************************************

Well, that's about it for those.  I think you will be satisfied.  Now, onto the Berceuse.

It seems to me that something is corrupting the file that I don't know about or can't diagnose.  I got it running in 93e just fine, including the viewer.  However, in 100, no dice.  The viewer crashes on the first page turn, yet continues playing without the program being open!  The editor also crashes on the page turn.  I will check with Brent on this.  Nevertheless, I'm attaching it so you can give it a shot...I'm sure you know some tricks I don't. 

There is a two-pager by Meyerbeer that I've spent alot of time on, trying to avoid crashes.  I get the pages bound and put copyright, title, etc. on them, then render and save, and INEVITABLY the thing crashes and I can't open the final file without a crash.   Brent suspects it's specific to this file.  Should I keep trying or move on - it's really holding things up (6hrs. last week!).  Let me know.

One more thing.  I'm getting things from everyone now, and want to know how to prioritize them.  Are we printing these Schirmer things up as a set or individually?  What about the other stuff ('collection litolff')?  Let me know.

Thanks,

Ben

Hi Gary,

	I attached the file for Jayne's question to this one(oops!).  

	The number of crashes I'm getting with the formatter is incredible: nearly every page.  Are there any general rules you can let me in on.  Do repeats crash the formatter; if so, how do I remedy?

Thanks,

Hi Gary,

	I'm not sure what to do with this message I received from Jayne.  Is there a central directory ("To:Sunhawk") now?   Thanks.  As far as the crashes go, logging the bug does nothing in the immediate future, which is when I'm expected to finish editing these pieces.  Is cam going to respond to me directly, or indirectly with a new build?  I'm not asking you to diagnose the problem, just if you have any advice.  Thanks. :)

Hi Gary,

>There is a bug on page 1, bottom system:
>(1) Graces at beginining of system don't play (build 102)
>(2) Augment dot in that measure is way off to right.
I didn't use 102, assuming if it worked with 100, it would with 102.  The grace note, if you remember, had to be added invisibly at the end of the previous system, so it doesn't light up.  I assume, though, that this isn't the problem.   If cam responds via email, could you forward it to me? I want to know how to fix this stuff.

Hi Gary,

	Thanks.  I guess that's what I needed to hear.  When Cam responds with "fixed" in Raid, do I get the file over email, or does it go to you and straight to the web?

Did I say rests?  I meant notes.  That is, one grace note, attached to the last actual note of the second to the last system, although looking back now, I realize I deleted it once everything played right in Build 100!  Sorry about that.

Hi Gary,

	FYI: I've got pages 13-31 of the Emil Waldteufel music done, but two buggy pages prevent me from sewing everything up and completing it.  Also, I need to know how to midi wire the repeats and whatnot.  Just so you know I haven't been sitting idle.  :)

Hi Gary,

	I was also referring to two pages, each of which lie smack in the middle of said songs (two long ones).  Both of them,Emwa1_18.rms & Emwa1_26.rms, are going to need to be rescanned if they are fixed by Cam.  How long do I wait?  Who do I ask to rescan it and do I then direct it to the 1st-passer, or is that your job?

Thanks,
Ben

It sounds like a rescan isn't the answer.  I guess I will re-recognize.  This takes a long time, does it not?  I guess I'll do it at night.

Hi Gary,

	Here are three Art of Fugue pieces.  I edited them in 87, had problems with page size, then finally got 100 to work.  So, these are all from build 100 and play perfectly.

	A few questions:
	Too cramped?  Should I use a different rastral setting?  
	Is the title info. allright?
	Should I be testing these in 102 as well?

Thanks,

Hi Gary,

	Before you submit the Bach pieces I sent you (assuming I edited well!) I would like to change them to rastral 5, if that's alright with you -- I think it looks MUCH better, and would like to use r5 on the remaining pieces.  Thanks.

Hi Gary,

	I had a windows question for you:  Is there someway to program the function keys (or a shorter sequence) with a key sequence like "<alt>+t,a,l" (align left)?  On macs they call this a macro.  It would save time if I didn't have to let go of the mouse and use both hands for this, since I'm a horrible typist and it takes a sec for me to find the keys.

Hi Gary,

	Trying to clean up the old problems...remember this one? 

	I tried to recognize in 87 and I got the blotches.  83b isn't available from the store.  I will try the other builds, but assuming they won't work, please advise.  Since everyone will be gone until mid. of next week, except maybe Jayne, I figured I'd finish these up and try to fix the rest of the "back burner" problems I've been saving for this time.

	I listened to the first movement of the Mozart and have only instrument gripes; I couldn't find the error on p. 9..could you be more specific in where you think it is?  Also, when I attempted to begin playing on p. 9 (after the repeat!) it would not play (this is using the viewer).  Looks great, you got my list of things I trust.

Thanks,

Ben

Here is the corrected version of the Verdi.  On p.3, everything was VERY buggy to begin with.  I think my ears got fried a bit (3-4 hours, I think, for just that page).  I went ahead and replaced the grace notes with invisible graces in the previous measure, although usually we don't need to in the middle of a system.  On p.4, I think I forgot to save after fixing this voice info stuff in sys. 5.

Hi Gary,

	I had logged this as a bug, then spent a few hours on it today.  I found a work-around while editing Contr4&5.

Hi Gary,

	I had to mess with the durations of the arpeggios on pages 2 and 3, to assure proper articulation of the notes preceding them.  Let me know if I did this well; it sounds good to me.

Hi Gary,

Right now, five files are assembled yet buggy:

via Miriam: carmen.rms (4 pgs.) meyer.rms (2) Thom1.rms (3 or 4, I can't open it)
via Margaret: Berceuse.rms (10)
via Jayne: Emwa1siren.rms (8) This doc is buggy because there is a bug with section order (or something related) in 103.  Jayne did some editing in 103, pinning me to 103 onward.  I have 20 pages (all Jayne has given me save three) final edited, waiting for assembly.  My plan was to talk to Brent to see if there was a workaround, then tinker with the pages after I catch up with margaret's stuff (should be today or tomorrow).  Should I drop everything and get going on Emil?

Also, I was wondering about Mark's message to all the 1st passers this morning.  It seemed pretty out of the blue, and went totally against what I've been telling my 1st-passers from day one: stick to 87.  It makes my job ALOT easier.  I'm not sure if I should say something to Mark or not, but it's a little aggravating.  What to do?

Ben

Hi Gary,

	I received no word to get going on 104c specifically.  I tried to debug some older things (berceuse, meyer), but ran into the same problems -- maybe a file prob. as opposed to a buggy build?  I will use it from now on, if it's stable (glad to hear it finally is!)

Hi Gary,

	Thought you might want to know I conferenced called (well, they were all at the same house, so SORT of a conference call :) my 1st passers yesterday.  This was extremeley benificial to both parties; walking them through some of the problems discussed on email clarified EVERYTHING.  I would highly suggest it to the other editors.

Hi Gary,

	I was informed by Brent that there is a bug in the page turning when there is extensive section order material.  Here is the first piece via Jayne, with lots of sec. order stuff.  It will crash in the editor after the first page, but plays fine in the viewer.  
	I put fermatas (invisible) at the end of No. 1 and No.2, thinking it was appropriate.

Hi Gary,

	Here are two more Contrapuncti.  I used 70000 for the ritard; I think it sounds alright.  Lemme know.
	In no.8, sys 5, meas 1, there is an upward trill w/a vertical line through ala a mordent.  Do you know what this is?  I couldn't find it w/trills in any of my music dictionaries, and had to build it with a graphic/line, so I'm sure it isn't playinf right.

	Here are some corrections, and contr10.rms.  The updated style doc is also included.  Let me know how it looks; not much added.  I can't remember if you wanted me to add that 'leading text' part or not -- eg 'contrapunctus 9...etc' on the contrapuncti.  Thanks!

Hi Gary,

	Here is a shorty from Miriam.  I have been ridden by bugs all week -- FYI, 21 pages in 4 docs held up by bugs.  
	If you have a chance, will you take a look at the attahed .rms file.  This Contrapunctus (12) is printed with it's inversion (!) which explains the staff of eight bars.  Do you want me to parse this out into 2 separate Contrapuncti (12a & 12b?) or maintain the original, in which case you will need to advise on midi playback.  Thanks!!

Hi Gary,

	Finally done!  This one was particularly tough due to it's chromatic nature...  I think I caught most errors via visual check, but on this I DEFINITELY could be wrong!  Lemme know.

Hi Gary,

	I was in a bit of a rush yesterday, as my ride was waiting, so I didn;t get a chance to ask you: May I take the 22, 25, 26, and 27th of August off?  This is Friday and Monday-Wednesday.  I spoke to Brent, and he didn't forsee any Waner activity until after these dates.  This is what my phone call was about today, so no need to call if you see this message first.  Thanks!

Hi Gary,

	At the meeting it was said that we would present potential problems to the finish list before raiding them.  Is this still the case?  I would be glad to raid them; it saves the step of emailing everyone! :)  Hope Russia was fun.  Talk soon.

Hi Gary,

	I'm preparing a string quartet (my own) for performance and wonder if you have settings for rastrals higher than 7.  What is standard for "dense chamber score"?   Rastral 7 leaves too little room in many cases.  I played a bit with the width and height, and liked what I saw, but thought I'd check with you for neatness' sake.  Thanks!

I'm catching some errors that other people missed in these files.  For example, the way solero draws a chord, the dots on the first fret need to be jogged down a bit to avoid collision with the nut.  For an example, see the hanson song 'mmmbop'; specifically, the E chords.  The dot on the first fret collides with the nut.  Should I go through and fix, or wait for Lorick's fix in the code (Brent said it's on the way).

Hi Gary,

	Margaret sent me the message below.  The quartet file she speaks of does appear in Glenda's priority Excel doc, but not in bold.  Margaret is currently working on Franck solo violin material.  Should she switch to the priority stuff? 

	Could you take a look at what Miriam and Jayne have on the priority doc, as well, and tell me what you want them working on?  Jayne is still on Waldteufel (drek), and Miriam/Jennifer are on Rachmanninoff (sp?).

Thanks,

Hi Ben-
Have been too busy to work this week so have not done much with the new
build.  If I am reading things correctly, it seems that I should stop what I
am doing and edit smqc2 Quartette.... Op 41 #11.  Is this correct?

The other files which have my name opposite are the ones which I have
already sent to you and they are waiting for things there.  Correct?

Thanks
Margaret

Works for me.

I will give you a call, going over my plan for the presentation, on Tuesday.  I want to run it by you and make sure I've covered everything.  

Two questions:

	1) Is everyone dealing with 'distance' 1st-pass editors i.e. no 1st-passers live in town?

	2) Shall I make up an Excel doc as well, or do you have a template?  I thought you had said something about a template..

Thanks,

Hi Gary,

	Refresh my memory... I can't remember what we decided on in terms of offloading 1st-passers to Ian.  Since school is starting, and I will be fluctuating between 30 and 40 (more towards 40) for the next three months, I thought I'd give Ian Margaret and Jayne.  Maybe this is too much?  Let me know.

Hi Gary,

	The Beethoven piece, when 1st-pass edited, was formatted 'complete' as opposed to pages.  As a result, it is WAY too spread out; a 27 page piece has become a 39 page piece.  I think this is unacceptable the way it is, and am not sure how to rectify.  Advice?  Let me know if you want to see it, it's a bit large to attach unwarranted.

Hi Gary,

	I assume you just read my email to the 1st passers.  I spoke to Ian, and we were assuming we could get the raw files and workspaces for these files, as well as what's coming from Jayne and Margaret, burned on a CD rom for Ian.  I need the ones I have, because they contain what Miriam and Jennifer have sent/will be sending.  If this is between me and Tacoma, lemme know. :)

Chopin's Nocturne, Op. 27, No. 1
5 pages
was just sent to the Web site.

It's Ben McAllister's first finish-edited tune with Sunhawk!
Congratulations Ben!

Look for it on our site soon.

Thanks,
Gary

...It does say "look for it..soon", so perhaps it was held up at some point.  The last filename I know of is simply 'chopin1.rms', which probably isn't much help.  I can send you my copy if need be, but will need to neaten it up (I assume) to meet current style.  Let me know.

I am so embarassed.  Sorry!  I'm losing my mind dealing with school... :(

G. Total accumulated pages

		From 1st passers: 25

My priorities now are the "O'sullivan" songs (Judy's calling them this, but they are actually by O'Morrison), which I must assemble (the recognizer isn't catching much - sometimes not event the rastral - from the scans), 1st pass, and final edit.  Next down is the Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 21, which I am having problems with due to reformatting.  After much trial and error, Brent and I have found that I'll have to export each page individually in order to use time effectively when editing this.  This explains the high number of pages blocked by bugs.  Getting the Berceuse through (thanks Gary) diminished this number by 6, incidentally.

I like the look of rastral 4, as far as the overall look of the page is concerned, but I wonder about the readability.  ie Will anyone with less than 20/20 vision strain to read such a page?  It seems borderline.  When they're posted, you may want to take a look at what I've been doing.

Hi,

	I agree with the suggestion of having a senior editor take a look at everything before it goes out.  I wonder if, due to the chord grid size of the guitar chords, it might be a little unclear to some what may look good or bad, since the original can't always be used as a guide.
	I think everything's clear enough for the EMI stuff to look great and get done quickly, but it might be a good case in point for the next meeting, since the material seems to be so varied this time.  We could certainly implement something (senior editor contact for questions like this) in the structure to take care of this quick.  :)

Hi Gary,

	Sorry, I guess I'm still figuring out how to use Eudora.  I had sorted by sender, thinking it would keep the date order -- WRONG!  I looked on Ian's email, saw 10/21, and found no email there.  I've now figured out my problem: sort date, sender, then date, and it comes up.  Sorry for the bother, but EVERY TIME I sorted I only saw one email! :)

Hi Gary,

	You had asked me to send these down to you for slotting.  Everything looks fine to me, except the placement of Chord texts-my printer is printing them 'creatively'.  Thanks.

Hi Gary,

	Glancing through my guitar books, there seems to be no universal standard.  In my larger editions, I find more of your last option: everything normal and numbers superscript (or the entire extension i.e. 'Em' normal and '(#7b9)' superscript.  I believe this solves the basic problem: having the eye read the 'basic' chord data, and noticing the extension quick due to superscript.  I know a lot of jazz players would only mind the basic info, and consider the extension an option (usually to be taken, of course.  Anyone else?

Hi Gary,

	I wanted to check with you: I'm planning to visit my girlfriend's parents in Arizona for Thanksgiving -- this would mean I would be off Monday through Friday (24-28).  I'm planning to work extended hours the week before, and the weekend after I go (so I can save my vac. time for Christmas), so there should be no net loss of work from me.  Is this ok?  Thanks.

Hi Gary,

	I have most of these. I couldn't get 'i've got a crush on you' to render, and logged it as bug 2816.  The rest will be done by tomorrow.  I just slotted 'it ain't necessarily so' and am about to send "Let's do it". Then "s'wonderful", "summertime", and "you're the top" remain from me.

Hi Gary, 

	I figured out the bug on 'I've got a crush on you'-- I didn't multi voice before joining the pages (dumb, huh?).  So that one is in the slot.  I will close the bug in raid.

Hi Gary,

	I think what isn't addressed is the apparent amount of time 'wasted' working around the older formatting.  It seems, to me anyway, that we would take more time working around the older formatting than would be spent by rescanning and giving it to a 1st-passer.  I'm only speaking from one experience, the 21st piano sonata by Beethoven, which went from 20 to 39 pages.  These 39 pages would be MUCH more flexible if they were in separate files than in one large file.  Exporting them, by the way, took just about 2 hours, believe it or not!
	Just a concern for the company's funds! :)

Hi Gary,

	I was under the impression that you simply connected the playback hint to the material to be played.  Then, in the edit box for the hint, the 'value' is the repeat # (1 for 1st rpt, etc).  I'm not sure if you could connect it to the staff icon instead; it's not mentioned in the email the programmers put out on this.

Hi Gary,

	On the majority of my WB lead sheets (done in rastral 4), I changed the point size of the lyric from 30 (as indicated on the style sheet) to 24.  I did this both because I thought the 30 point was far too large and the page was simply cluttered, and in order to better match the original.  This point of matching the original was indicated as a priority in one of your emails, and I believe we spoke about it on the phone, too.
	I wanted to confirm that we finishers have a little 'editorial latitude' on this point (lyrics); I don't think it's entirely clear to everyone.  I am aware of the obvious problem of consistency, but I feel if one tune is easier to read in, say, 20 point, it should be put in 20 point rather than 24, or 30.  If we MUST be consistent with point size, I think it should be the lowest common denominator in the equation: in my case, 20 point (which was used on only one out of eight tunes).

Hi Gary,

	I'm not necessarily talking about a collision; I want to know if I have the authority to make a subjective choice.  Maybe I'm not being clear enough.

	You said at one point that matching the original was, at least partially, a priority.  I'm wondering what amount freedom we have when it's something as touchy as a WB tune.

Hi Gary,

	Back in August, we had a problematic file from the Art of Fugue which contain the straight and inversion versions of the fugue -- all on the same system.  Youself, Rick, Marlin and I had a few emails about it, and the decision was made to have two playback hints, one for each four staves.  I believe there were a few layout issues you had with it to, but I can find no emails from the period which resolve them.  Because we have had higher priorities since this file came up, it has resided on a very distant back burner.
	In moving all of my unedited files from my box to malibu, Glenda and I have decided to log this one in raid, with the bug being assigned to yourself.  If you want to take a look at the files, the pages are named bw25_055.rms thru bw25_060.rms.  Take care.

Hi,

	I have ran option 2 a few times, particularly to find a spot that crashes in a piece which I have built from scratch (recent guitar stuff).
I will note any odd behavior, but so far it has run as expected.

Hi Gary,

	I think it would be a good idea to sit down next week and modify the style manual to match Warner's choices for text object sizes in guitar pieces.  They are VERY consistent throught the five pieces I've done so far.
	I know we talked about this a bit but it might be helpful to write something down for other editors/slot to refer to, since I believe things will appear somewhat different (ie many things are smaller) than usual.
	Also would like to talk to you about bug priorities, now that the guitar stuff is coming to the fore.

Thanks,

It is logged as bug #3752 which, incidentally, you assigned a BETA priority to.. maybe you want to change that?  :)

Hi Gary,

	In a new piece, the italian lyrics contain something that looks like a parenthesis lying on it's back.  It appears like this:

so-gno_al-l'o

and 

gno_al appears under ONE NOTE.  I'm substituting the underline for the new mark here.  Suggestions?

Hi Gary,

	There's a fundamental error underlying the problem, that of notated time event lists rendering with the wrong number of ticks.  This usually happens on a rhythm staff where a note is tied over the barline.  This is the culprit on p2, s4, m2. (Maybe show the satellite offices this syntax for identifying prob areas in scores?)  The (work-araound) solution is to change to time sig time event lists in these measures.
	The problem at the top of the page ACTUALLY occurs at the beginning of s2, and is two-fold.  First, the section text must ALWAYS(!!!!!!) be attached to the TOP staff of a given sys.  Otherwise, the song render thinks the staff(s) above the section text (in their case, the rhythm staff) are part of the previous section.  Second, the rhythm staff contains a tie and therefore has the wrong # of ticks.  I'm sure I logged this one but will relog with my NEW TEST CASE! :)  Thanks. 
	The notes not lighting up on p3 are due to the section text problem mentioned above.  I corrected the connections and all is well.
	They didn't add the place-holding rhy. staves for consistency in the instrument names.  I would suggest they do this and see how/why it works, so I didn't add them.
	I attached "gdburnotrev" for your perusal, edited in 118t. The playback issues, save addition of rhy staves, have been fixed (event lists/section texts).  See ya soon.

Hi Gary,

	As far as I can tell, they are simply a bit confused/careless when entering new barlines in an existing sys, or when adding new staves to existing systems. Lorick's code, which makes new systems conform to an existing system's bar-layout, was still in it's infancy in 188d/f -- the occasional plumbing bug was a result.  I think that is mainly the case here, but there was one or two where it seemed the user was at fault, particularly when an event list on one sys was linked to a barline on ANOTHER.  The code wouldn't do that.  
	Also, the lyric wizard was still buggy back in d/f, hence all the improperly connected lyrics.  These were most likely deleted lyrics which, for some reason, left behind this improper connection 'residue' in d/f...  Hope that helps!!

Is it unreasonable to think we can get on the same page with this stuff?  It seems that a unified 'production' schedule for builds is mandatory in this system we have going ie merging code from a separate facility.  This seems to underscore the disorganization!  :)  ??

Hi Nicholas,


I went ahead a looked at Traffic Jam. In general, everything looks good, but I did find a few issues you'll want to check out.  
	1:  In lyrics, all apostrphes are enter using alt+0146, instead of the 'straight' apostrophe on the keyboard.  You may hear these special apostrophes reffered to as 'curvy'.
	2:  The lyrics, overall, look a bit crowded to me, despite using our recommended point size of 30.  What we can do is reduce the point size to 28, then to 26 if that's not enough.  Use your best judgement on this.  Also, there are a few collisions between hyphens and the syllables they fall between.  To avoid this, it's a good idea to check the prinout thoroughly; the collision may not be as easy to detect on-screen.
	3:  Gary neglected to mention the Warner copyright text. This goes at the bottom of the first page, underneath the copyright info specific to the piece.  I've attached a page containing the text (notices.rms), which you can cut and paste to your document, as well as a page (wbst2_02.rms) showing the placement of the text.  Try to keep the space between the lines of text consistent; no great space is need between the general and specific copyright texts.
	4:  When a lyric word has an extension line, it's necessary to connect the lyric to all words the extension line falls under.  This will cause the program to extend the line appropriately.  It's done in the lyric wizard, using the 'attach note' button.  The lyrics on this page can be re-edited in the lyric wizard by ctrl-clicking between two syllables of the line in question, or you can simply select the lyric and ctrl-click on the notes you want connected.
I understand you are in 118d. In this build, the lyric wizard had a few bugs, so Gary will ftp you 118v later today.  You will find it a bit more comfortable I'm sure!
	5:  In 118v, the x notes are plotted better, so they will need to be updated in the new build.  This entails selecting a note, and 'wiggling' it back and forth (ctrl+left arrow, ctrl+right arrow).  You'll see the new stem position at this point.

Got all that? :)  Hope it's clear enough.  We'll be in contact over the phone as well, so I'll be able to clarify anything you need me to at that point.
Now...
 >(2) Respond to your query in this mail regarding formatting of
>Three to Get Ready (Test files: Wbgb1024.rms, 3test.rms)

This is after a quick look.  Let me know if there are more problems after these are fixed.  
The error check is very useful in situations where you have no idea what's screwing the formatter up.  I ran errors check and saw that, for some reason, the grace notes are linked to a voice icon.  In fact, there is a great deal of material connected to voices that shouldn't be.  Go ahead and disconnect all unnecessary connections, and format pages.  You will have to re-edit a bit, sorry!  
If after this you still have problems with the grace notes, try disconnecting the slurs and formatting the problem measures.  This occasionally helps.

Also, on the issue of grace notes, the grace note steals time from the note it is connected to.  In this piece, these are all graces (not appoggiatura), and so need to be connected to the note/rest immediately preceding them.  This will clean up the playback, and therefore the formatting.  

>(3) Respond to your query regarding problems with Walkin.zip

Gary will also ftp you the newest version of the manual.
Take a look again at the manual, under "understanding Solero", and you'll find an exhaustive section on Formatting.  It sounds like you looked under "editing a sunhawk score"! ;)  Not gonna do it (yet).  Review this area of the manual in general, and remember to error check before formatting! 
Regarding lyrics, see "procedures index --> text and lyrics" in the manual for instructions on using the lyric wizard.

Once you understand how the editor works with music, you'll be in fine shape.  Don't be frustrated; the editor can be pretty counter-intuitive at times, but I think you'll find it an easy way to get the job done!  I'll follow this up with a phone call on Monday.  Take care!

I didn't get it.  You did tell him to send everything to music@, so maybe he assumed that's the ONLY place he should've sent it?

He may be experiencing this due to 95/98 bugs, unless he says he's using nt.  On the phone, he expressed to me that he had no problems on the 95 or 98 (I don't recall which) machine he was using..  Please advise. :)

Hi,

	I've received a few emails from Nicholas about two more new pieces!  I belive that brings the count up to 7 tunes that he is in the process of finishing!  I'm not responding to the emails, as Jill advised this morning.  I would suggest we communicate my lag-time to him, however.  Thanks!

Hi,

	I've been working on a 22 pager and just completed the individual pages.  I experienced a crash after the assembly in 118y and x, and so tried w -- once again a crash.  The nature of the crash is this: I have error checked the pages individually, yet the error log fills with incorrectly linked notes once the pages are merged.  The error check options do no good in this case.  Once the problem notes are idividually nuked and replaced, the problem persists (and was logged): the midi playback begins, but no notes light up, and no page turns occur.  Any advice?

I'm using it intermittently.  It messes with some objects, eg tempo, if they were created in previous builds.  This makes it difficult enough that I stay at 104c/d if possible.  I'll start in 106d and report bugs.  However, I think we should give it a few days before we pass it on to the 1st-passers, no?

I say 7 from recent experience, but this is of course subject to change.  7 is 'safe', while 6 can get you into trouble ie pages 1-5 look fine, 'but I can't get the gtr chds on page 6'!

As far as the parens go, I say text '(   )' (that's 3 spaces, sometimes 2 is ok) when there's one number, and two tie/slurs for a chord.

Hi Gary,

	Here's what I've caught after a visual check:

	- In General: I think the system separator (what do you call those again? -- the two slashes between the systems) could be bigger, at least for the 8.5x11 paper size.  Also, I think the copyright notice could be smaller.  Now on to the nitpicking...

1) p.1: This also goes for the whole score - if you look at the strings on p.1, the 3 in the triplets may look better above the beams.  They look a little bit cluttered witht he slurs now, in many places.
2) p.1: The P mark in the lower strings should be aligned, maybe by P below the cello's D? or between the Vcl. mark?
3) p.2: I guess the P mark in 2) and here, in Vcl. line, bottom right, is bound above, to denote that it affects the vcl. and not the bass?  I thought dynamics were exempt from this rule, and the P could therefore be below the staff without problems.
4) p.3: The 'f' and 'bassi' at the bottom of top system is inconsistent with how it appears on p.1, bottom of 1st system.
5) p.5: Slurs in flute, top right in second system, could move down a bit, to avoid clutter (slightly) with ledger lines.
6) p.6: 1st meas, 1st sys, bassoon: slur could be lengthened and moved a bit to avoid clutter w/staff line & clef.
7) p.6: 8th meas., 2nd sys, Violin 1: I believe piano marking is supposed to be under the 'a', right?  Here it appears between the 'a' and 'f#'
8) p.7: meas 1, sys 1, Violins: piano markings should be aligned.
9) p.7: meas 2, sys 2, trumpet and trombone: forte marking should be aligned.
10) p.7: meas 2, sys 2, viol and vcl/bass: arco marks should be aligned.
11) p.8: meas 2,3,4, sys 2, vcl/bass: flats collide in first half of each of these bars. also in oboe and bassoon in meas.8, sys 2.
12) p.8: meas 9, sys 2, bassoon: slur in 1st beat should be above notes.
13) p.9: flats collide with slurs in meas 2, sys 1, viola and vcl/bass; meas 3, sys1, violin 2; meas 3, sys 2, violin 2.
14) p.10: meas 3, last half of beat, sys 1, oboe and bassoon are out of alignment.
15) p.10: last meas, sys 1, 1st beat, could slur be below notes (g# & b) to avoid clutter?
16) p.11: 2nd meas, sys 1, oboe, is piano marking supposed to be below line?  If it demarks 2nd oboe, compared to other places in score already discussed, shouldn't it be above the staff? (Unless the new oboe is playing the lower note.. in that case, forget this one :)
17) p.11: meas 4, sys 1, violins, last beat, triplet numerals collide; last meas, sys 1, trombone and timpani, forte marks collide w/barline.
18) p.11: meas 2,3,4,sys 2, 2nd violin, triplet numerals collide.
19) p.12: meas 6, sys 1, flute, piano mark collides w/barline; last meas, sys 1, bassoon, 'I.' mark could move to the left a bit, to avoid obscuring staccato mark; meas 5, sys 2, bass, bassi mark collides with stem; last meas, sys 1, bassoon, 2nd beat, triplet numeral could move up a bit to avoid colliding w/staff line.
20) p.13: meas 2, sys 1, vcl. mark collides w/slur.
21) p.14: meas 1, sys 1, oboe's 'I.' mark collides w/slur; violin's piano marks should align.
22) p.14: meas 5, sys 2, violin 1, forte collides w/stem, and triplet numerals collide.
23) p.15: meas 5, sys 1, violin 2, last note, looking at surrounding staccato marks, shouldn't this dot move up?
24) p.16: meas 1, sys 1, viola, piano mark collides w/stem
25) p.17: meas 1, sys 2, oboe, flats collide on downbeat.
26) p.19: meas 1, sys 1, bassoon, sharp collides w/slur, and forte mark looks a bit out of alignment; meas 1, sys 1, violin 1, shouldn't there be a forte mark there?

>Kelly joined the JET program (Japanese Engligh Teachers -- sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Education). She came to Japan in July. I waited in the States for a few months then came for a visit. Turns out, I adore Tokyo. At the time I was running a record label in Seattle (that eventually failed miserably!) and I thought I could open up a Tokyo branch office. After struggling through heaps and heaps of Japanese red tape I kind of gave up on the idea and went to work for a consulting company, although I have made quite a few really good contacts in the Tokyo music scene. Hardships followed (ie... couldn't get a working visa) and so I went back to the States when my tourist visa expired. Stayed in Seattle for four months and found out that I am really fucking miserable in the States! Flew back to Tokyo a month or so ago and started working again. Now it turns out that I probably won't get a visa this time around either but rather that go back to the States when my visa expires (July 15th), I am now thinking of spending a few months in Katmandhu (cheap, cheap, cheap) and then maybe on to Vietnam (where I have some friends and it is SUPER cheap). Maybe China and Thailand as well. Wanted to go to Indonesia next month but I don't think that is too bright! 
>
Damn you got it goin on.  No, I wouldn't do Indonesia either.  What's up with you and Kelly?  Is this still serious or do you guys have some sort of UNDERSTANDING?  Last I heard she was leavin the country, so I have no idea.  what connections?  Check out any noise bands from (I think) Osaka?  There's this one I really dig called Omoide Hatoba.  Check 'em out if you can. Med. Hat played with them the only time they've played in Seattle (therefore granting us ROCK LEGEND status) and they were this clean-cut group of Frat looking guys.  Next thing you know it's rhythm/noise collage for an hour straight.  They had weird signals they gave to each other to start/stop things, so they sounded 'tight', in  a way.  Anyway, might be your thing, might not.
What's the long term with the Visa thing?  Can you look forward to something stable eventually, or do you want that?


>So, commuting in Tokyo during rush hour is an experience to last a lifetime. I ride the subway for at least 3 hours a day. Ever seen pictures of the Tokyo subway system? There are conductors on the platform that help squeeze 3 or 4 hundred people into a car designed to hold 100! Sometimes they use this cattle-prod like device. I am not shitting you!

That's gotta be bullshit cause I just saw him the other day at school.  He's doing his PhD now, and seems a bit mellower. Maybe he finally got his ass kicked?  (cross fingers)  He seems cooler but who knows, I haven't gone out with him yet.

Shane Murray as daddy! Kind of cool really. I guess they just bought a house on an island just outside of Bergen (where the hell is outside of Bergen??? That must be hell!). He says that he has been teaching the Norwegians a little bit of the old Krady Krit! Imagine that...

Ja das ist guten und awetome dude buck.  Say hey to shane and gimme his address/phone.. I gotta talk to that guy.

>How goes the music stuff? Last I heard you were doing something for a documentary (Korean War?)... how'd that go?
So the Korean War thing.  You heard about that from me what, like, a year or so ago?  Maybe more?  The guy producing it just about got hauled to court before he finished the thing, because he took pre-orders for it and didn't deliver within '4-6 weeks' but, like, 1.5 years.  My brother's boss, to boot.
We finished a movie that's getting a little bit of festival attention and Andy's trying to raise 10k for his feature, which we'll shoot this summer. Zombie road movie, of course.  
Music wise I got a studio space recently, an adat and board, and a bit more equiptment, and I'm hopefully gonna put out an ep at the end of the summer.  It'll come out on Collective Fruit, the label that put out the MH cd.
For the past eight months, I've been working on this one same chamber piece for Saxes, Bass Clarinet, Piano, Vibes, Bass, and 2 percussionists.  It's finally done and will be played/recorded (at the u they say 'premiered'. fuckin fancy shit right?) in Dec.  It may suck who knows.

Me too.  Funny you email 'cause none other than JASON KEAN calls me last night and says "whats up I'm getting married Sunday!!?!"  He's heavy into the computers working for IBM and ... aw fuck I don't remember but he's livin in Redmond making the ripe coin.  Has a spiral staircase and everything.  Wow. I'm doing this sound design coding in school right now, using these two languages (Csound, kinda like assembly, and Common Music, alot like lisp) and programming alot, so he sayd he can get me a job like THAT.  He does a lot of hiring.  Craig is floating around, doin it with some other divorced person and basically diggin another deep dark hole for himself instead of going on an insane bender, exploring drug use, drying out, and thinkin about it, which is what I would do.  So.. Jason may hook him up which at least would get him out of QFC.  I saw him (craig) a couple of months ago a few times, and every time he was just whipped to get home to this new chick, who for all I know he may be living with by now.  Thank god we didn't ALL fuck up!

>Oh, by the way, do you know how to get ahold of Craig? I have sent mail to one of his addresses and haven't heard back... I haven't talked to him for months (last time he was about to get divorced or something)....
Yes divorced.  I don't know an email for him.  If you wanna call him he's at the Parents, last I heard.  4257763270.  I'll let him know and try and hook you guys up.

Fuck good to hear from you man.  Keep it in touch.  Tell me more about what's goin on over there.

A note for Jessica:

Hi Jessica, 

	Could you look at p. 107, mentioned below, and see if you have a recognized copy?  Apperently, Miriam and Jennifer do not.

Thanks!

Hi Glenda,

	I'm not sure whom to direct this to, but we need a CDROM assembled for Ian Rashkin.  He is now handling files 1st-passed by Margaret and Jayne.
	I sent him the following files, which were in my backlog:
	Emwa2_12-55.rms		Emil Waldteufel collection 
	Bw25_75-102.rms		Bach Art of Fugue
	Cfqv1_1-9.rms			Franck Solo violin material.

	We need all all raws and workspaces (everything I get on my cds) for these files, as well as whatever Margaret and Jayne will be doing in the future, on a cd.  I haven't looked at the most recent cd I've received, but I assume it contains files which they will do, or are already doing.

	In addition, I need a cd with the raws and workspaces for all of the files which were on your priority list.  Those are now my main project! (Lucky me!)  If there are problems, I will be hard to get ahold of for the next few months since school started this week.  I will definitely be home tomorrow after 4:30.  Please call if there is confusion/a problem.  Thanks!

Hi,

	What should I be editing from the 1st passers?  I have a buildup of Rachmaninoff and am getting these String Quartet parts in random order.  That is, I get all parts for pages 3 and 4, then 10 and 11, etc.  If you've got a priority sheet for them, could I get a copy (or could you tell me if I missed it ;)?

Thanks so much,

Ben

Hi,

	Did you guys know that the Warner files you sent me weren't completely 1st-passed?  No fingerings, chord names, or text was included.  Thought you might want to know, for time tracking purposes.

For these files, please send me the individual page files.  That is, the files that were 1st-passed, but weren't joined to form a merged song file.  I realize the size of the email, so maybe send me this in chunks.  I definitely need them in separate, "already 1st-pass edited", pages.  Thanks!

This is 'page 2' of this piece; page one is file BMQV1_08.  Also, why only the 1st violin part.  Don't we want all parts?  At any rate, I only have BMQV1_09, no other pages/instruments on this one.  Please let me know the status on this as you find out.

I haven't received this either.  Please let me know the status on this one. These are fairly easy and I can get them up quickly if the 1st-passed pages are given to me.

Hi Glenda,

	I just completed the Mozart's Piano Sonata no. 5, and the only other high priority thing I have the files to do is Rachmaninoff Sonata no. 1.  However, I only have up to page 35, so I will need the rest of the pages...  eventually!

Thanks,

Hi Glenda,

	I think I am going to go ahead and take another sick day... This cold just won't let go!  Jill: I brought home the Hawaiian stuff and will be working on the style sheet at home; we will probably have the Hawaiian tunes slotted on Tues!

Hi Jessica,

	You sent me the .rms files in a 'page broken' state (sometimes only two systems to a page!).  Let's bag this for now, though, because I just got more stuff from Miriam this morning, and have been debugging her last batch all day!  I will go ahead and let you know when I need more stuff though--Thanks!

Hi,

	So, just so we're on the same page, I should stick to the priority document despite a backlog of stuff, 1st-passed from 'drek' collections.

I haven't received this from the 1st-passers yet.  I would appreciate you sending me their priority list so we can be on the same page.  Call anytime today, if you like.

To avoid this type of confusion, maybe I should include a third part to the weekly report, a sort of 'extended outlook', where I could tell you what I plan to work on after my current project?  :)

Hi Glenda,

	Many of my files already exist on Malibu (stuff I received from Miriam/Jen/Margaret), but in a previous version.  Permission to overwrite?
	Also: are the files on the priority sheet we went over Wed. going to Malibu, or staying on my drive, to be worked on 'when I get around to it'?

Thanks,

I have a lot of Enoch Light/Command records, a lot of 'unusual' lounge, and a bunch of Mancini.  I also have a LP copy of Sketches of Spain (Miles), but am unsure as to whether or not it's a reissue.  Also some Howard Roberts.  I think that's about it, but when I go home tonight I'll double check.  Anything sound good?

Hmm....  Let's see...  The syd is great, I'll be glad to send that.  I also have a tape with better versions of the early floyd stuff, So i'll try to incorporate that.  As far as zappa goes, I think I have everything I want, unless you have some orchestral stuff I don't, some guitar album outtakes, or anything with Ricky lanzelotti (I think that's his name, the guy who sings Zomby Woof)..  The beat the boot and ycdtosa series pretty much fills it all out, eh?  Anything besides zappa you have?

I'd definitely be into the yellow shark stuff, as well as the 66 and 67 stuff (could you tell me a bit?)  I'm definitely into the trade, jes' wouldn't listen to much more Zappa unless it's new stuff; I'm not much of a fan of this or that version of Peaches or whatever, y'know? :)  I'm definitely into the Yellow Shark, so I'll start making some tapes if you're positive on that one.  Thanks!

You wanted three tapes altogether, right?  
Ween/metal man (90)
Serious Music (60 min) (has the worlds greatest sinner and sinister footwear)
and the syd tape (90)

Could we trade these for the yellow shark, the 67 garrick show, and the 68 amsterdam, if that equals two 90s and a 60?  Thanks.

Ooops-- got you mixed with someone else.  We're actually talking everything below minus ween, right? Let me know if you want me to combine one side of serious music (worlds greatest sinner) with the metal man thing (with 15min leftover... I'll think of something) or if you want something else there...

Thanks for the quick reply.  I can download the files, thanks.

About the tape: I have a bit of this and that, but no beefheart.  I have a bit of rare zappa (Sinister Footwear-complete orchestral performance, the world's greatest sinner, and a tape of a radio show called "metal man has won his wings".., and the actual score to dog breath variations (which alot of people have been after)) and some live DEVO (if you're into that), LOTS of rare classical, and just got a tape of the Beatles (White Album) in mono (very different) and a tape of outtakes from said sessions.   Otherwise I'm useless!  Lemme know; I'm not much of a trader. Thanks!

Hi,

	I've been checking your site daily for months, and love it.  Thanks so much!
	For whatever it's worth, I'd suggest using John Oswald's "Replica" from Plunderphonic.  Also, I know the sound design technology well which Oswald used to create his collage, and would love to participate in any way deemed appropriate.  Thanks.  I can't wait to hear the show; I'm sure it'll do a man proud.

Hi Graham,

	I got a "realplayer can't play this type of document" when trying to listen to the show.  I'm using the new realplayer G2, not 5.0.   Maybe a problem with the software?
	Could I get a copy of the show once you get tapes?  I'd be willing to make copies for others, if so.  Thanks!

Hi Greg,

	So next week then?  It'll behoove us to practice the perc, vibes, and piano/bass next week then, at any rate (sax, perc 1, and bass cl can't come).. hmm.  What's the possibility of getting you and Jason (perc) together once outside of the regular sched?  Lemme know your availability.  Thanks!

Hi Greg,

	We need the stuff on the front of the perc. score (your stuff, wood blocks, triangle, brake drum, ride, crash) and vibes (which I assume are already coming).  We all got the (possibly misguided) word from last rehearsal that you were bring the percussion, so let me know of any problems and I'll help out as much as I can.  Thanks again.

Hey you guys!

	Thanks so much for helping.  The parts are on Malibu in users-->ben, and have obvious names.  I need help on the bass, piano, and vibe parts.  Jason, you said you could work on the vibes and bass, so Heather, you take the piano.  This is enough 'cause the piano has lots of weird stuff going on.  I'll copy these points of interest in the score.  Keep in mind, both of ya, that any line objects are blown out of the part, so we need to put 'em in.  I'll try to highlight anything that might be missing on the score, k?  
	I need 'em by Thurs eve.  I'll print out a copy of the score for ya and hand it off before the end of the day.  Thanks again you guys.  Drinks are on me come payday.

Hey!!!

How's it been goin?  I've got the quartet done (at least this movement) and want you to take a look.  Do you have the editor yet?  It's in build 108.  Talk to you soon!

Go to the store web site (https://store.sunhawk.com/), logon, click 'builds', then click 108.

This, incidentally, is a new and buggy build, but it works for this piece!  Don't try and play it, though. It will sound like hell, I think.

Not yet.  Still lotsa bugs.

Haha expert ya right.  Well, I think it has strengths, especially for the composer, which other editors (finale et al) don't have.  To put it another way: the way you put music on the page with Solero is more like actually writing than any other editor I've seen. :)

You're so nice.  Give a call, actually, and I'll walk you through the editor once you download it. K?

Hi,

	I just want to talk to you briefly about the playability of a few of the sections.  I have bowings in mind at parts, and want your opinions.  Any time I can call ya this week?  
	The parts are definitely on the way, but I think this is a preliminary draft.  After I talk with you and iron a few things out, I'll get the parts together.

Thanks so much!

Hi Ian,

	I got a call from Adam last night about auditioning for a band in the Young Composer's space on Thursday.  I was wondering if you'd mind me using your gear for it, so I wouldn't have to lag my stuff there (no car).  I can totally appreciate you saying no, but I'd appreciate it, and would, of course, instill your stuff with as many good vibes as I can muster.  

Thanks,

Hi Ian,

	Two things:
	Could you refresh my memory about what you need from me in terms of priority for the Bach stuff I showed you last week?  Did we decide to give the 1st-passers everything, since we'll be publishing it in the long run anyway?
	I think you can just give the 1st-passers as much as you can, at a time.  I gave Harry everything he needs for the database, so all the pieces in v27 should be in there. 
	and...
	Could you print out three batons for pp 45-47, the "Allegro Assai" from one of the Partitas, I think.  One baton is for the file as it will be reproduced (in this case, for Violin), one's for guitar w/out tab, and one is for guitar w/tab.  Make sense?  I had a cold all weekend so I may be a little out of it, though this is usually the case anyway...  This procedure of three batons is necessary for all these Bach pieces.  Thanks!

Hey Ian,

Did you ever make a baton for a violin version of 'BAGS2AL'?  It's one of the Bach pieces we're appropriating for guitar, but we want to publish a violin version as well.  If you gave it to me, I can't find it now (*shame*) so could you print another?   Thanks!

Could you print up a Baton for the following pieces:

1) SO4KE02T - 4 Concert Etudes Op. 31 (II) no. 2 (Tab Version)
2) September - it's the only decent soul tune I could find in the conference room there...  by Earth, Wind and Fire, from the 'Soul Food' soundtrack book. The composers listed are 'Maurice White, Al McKay and Allee Willis'.
3) The Batman Theme - Danny Elfman.  This is from 'Music from Batman - 15 Great Themes'.  

That should do me for a few weeks.  Thanks!

Hi Ian and everyone,

	The problem with the page (probably) is that the fourth system isn't linked to the page.  If you click on the number (1 in this case) in the upper left-hand corner, above the voices (sometimes affectionately called "fat-ladies" but maybe "fat-persons" is better), you'll see that the system icons (to the left of the brace) light up - all but the fourth one down.  Link the page to it, and you should be fine.  
	One tip I can think of in conjunction with this I got from Brent: if there's some 'mystery bug' in one of the systems, you can dis-include it from the page, and format everything else.  I guess a mystery bug would be something crashing the formatter but not showing up in the error check.  If you haven't gotten one of these yet, you will.  :)  See ya 'round.

Hey,

	I attached 'style01.rms' and forwarded you a rastral settings email I got awhile ago.  These give what standards we have for text on the page.  Beyond that it's on a case by case basis, I believe.  I'm sure Gary has some standards in mind, so run things by him.

Hi Ian,

	I sometimes find that if I place the section text DIRECTLY ON TOP OF the the first note of the section, this doesn't happen.  I think the section text works similarly to the -endos and ritards, in that their placement within the bar determines where they take effect.  Give it a go.

Hi,

	I agree.  If there is a page formatted document in our hands, we can still make whatever adjustments Tacoma may have had in mind (less clutter than the original, etc).  Having the document joined, as opposed to separate pages, slows things down once you get above ten pages or so, because of time spent saving.

Hey Ian,

	How's it goin?  Any chance you could play this concert (Seattle only)?  The rehearsal sched is a little overblown; I'll find out for you exactly when my piece is to be rehearsed, but this is the worst case scenario.  The part's not too tough, some blocks and cymbals supporting a drum kit part is all (maybe you remember the piece I've been workin on all year?  It's one of the perc parts in that piece.  If you can't play, could you pass this on to Scott?  Thanks.

Hi,

	I have been ignorantly busy for the past month, and have simply read your emails in horror.  How can I assist?  I have forwarded every one of them to people I know, but I feel it may be in vain.  The US govt is such a backpedalling entity; it wants to be UN policemen in one section of the world, if financially feasable, but will shirk it's self-appointed resposibilty in humanitarian efforts; Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Rwanda, and now in your neck of the woods.  
	My heartfelt apologies to you for the ignorance in my country.  What can I do?  Personally?  Let me know.

Sorry,

	The entry in the catalog specified no year inparticular.  It simply said '19.'  I was hoping this was an edition prior to the 1934...?  If not, please cancel the request.  Thanks!

The 'seattle express' page's top frame cuts off the bottom 1/3 of the time point info (TCC, 7th & (?), etc)..

Hi Jim,

	I wonder if we should address the features here like 'instrument name for this staff' and 'label for this staff' (if these work!).  I think we should definitely clarify what 'begin new group with this staff' means.

PS: let me know if I should raid these problems instead of sending them to you via email.

Hi James and everyone,

	I'm wondering how far down the priority list the lyric wizard is in the manual.  It's a confusing item to train someone on, and is used infrequently by many of us.  I think a section on this for reference would be helpful and time-saving for many.  I still have the email of Cam's original explanation of the Lyric Wizard, and send it to whomever I train!

	The organization of the manual is very intuitive - things are easy to find.  Thanks!

Ben

Hi Jim,

	The midi patches I've been using for the rock stuff are Acoutic Guitar Steel and Overdriven Guitar (clean/distorted sound).  Good point.  As far as a small, low priority tab piece, I can't offer you anything but a suggestion: alot of these WB pieces are fairly long, and I'm sure someone would be more than willing to let you do the last page (or two, time permitting!) of a given piece.  Heather did this for me and I was eternally (well, very) grateful.  I'll be out 'til about 4:30 today, so we can talk then if you're in.

Hi Jim,

	Everything seems fine with the printcat, as far as I can tell from some brief snooping...  One comment though:  If I were on Amazon or some other similar, catalog-driven purchasing venture, I would click on the title and get more info about the selection.  We don't provide this, and I think it's a little surprising to find it in your shopping cart instead!  I know this catalog caused a lot of headaches, but things like abbreviated contents and scans of the covers would really boost sales, I feel..  Make sense?  I'm still waking up.  :)-

Hi Jamie,

	I love your page.  It's finally led me to a vocoder kit!

	My question is: Is there any tech info on the Ondes Martenot anywhere??  I'm trying to use an unusual speaker design in an instrument of mine, but can find little or no advice.  Any ideas??

Thanks!!

Well, the rules are like this: it's a trade situation; you send me two blank maxell high bias 90 min blanks, or we trade one for one.  Got any boots/rarities you want to make a tape of to trade?  Let me know if you have a list.  If not, send two 90s, and a self addressed cassette mailer with 77 cents of postage (if you want it speedy) to:

10740 35th Ave NE

See.. I can't accept any money, so it's gotta be a pain if you're not into trading. Sorry for that!  :)

Jeez I don't know if I'm looking, I just am curious about what's out there.
I'm familiar with every audio application out there, and can code the techniques they all use by hand.  I'd like something sound design related, like maybe mking sound effects for games or some shit.  Is all the work usually contracted?  That would be cool.

I have to agree: he had a great attitude and seemed gung ho to apply that to Sunhawk.  The only red light was his (lack of) formal training, but I have a feeling he's compensated by his family, who are all (parents and one grandparent) music teachers in one capacity or another.  I'm thinking the run-through of the editor/test will determine this one; if he fails, obviously we can't use him!  Other than this, I like the guy and trust he'd do a good job.

Hi Jayne,

	Nice to 'meet' you. :)  I have already been sent something of Margaret's via Gary, so I guess he is the man to ask as far as any "go ahead".  As far as questions go, fire away and I will do my best.  Looking forward to working with  you!

Hi Jayne,

	I appreciate the effort -- this program can be a pain, eh?  No worries about the timing and whatnot, I'll fix that.  I won't be getting to this until next week, so you'll hear from me on it then.  Thanks!

Hi Jayne,

	I'm just beginning to edit these, and am wondering if you have the first piece from the beginning.  It starts with Emwa1_14.rms, "Sirenenzauber".   If you could 1st-pass 14-16, I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks so much.

Hi Miriam,

	Thanks so much.  If you have any tricks as far as getting past tricky errors ("no link to subid" comes to mind) let me know. These files look really good except for the "weird" glitches -- you must be getting to know the editor pretty well.  :)

Yes.

Yes.  If it isn't linked, the formatter thinks it's a regular part of the measure, and lines up the other staff accordingly.  For example, if there is an unlinked grace note immediately before a quarter on beat one in the right hand,  the formatter will interpret the grace note as the downbeat, the quarter will occur on the AND of one, and so on; everything will be displaced by one eighth note.  Sorry, I know its a pain.


>(3)I have understood that we link it to a note not a rest, could you clear
>this up for us? 
Basically, you need to keep in mind that the grace note steals time.  Aurally, it anticipates the note ahead of it quickly or "gracefully (don't blame me, I didn't coin the term ;).  It's also a notational short hand: if you were to work out the actual rhythm for a grace note, the note behind it would be a triple dotted eighth note (or equivalent) with a thirty-second (or sometimes sixty-fourth) note beamed to it.  See attached .rms.

No problem.  Keep 'em coming.

Hi Jayne,

	How was Oliphant?  Hope you had fun.  Sorry to lay this chore on you right as you come back!  
	These files were too trashed to format, so I re-recognized them. The attached .zip file contains everything you will need.  Please drop everything :) and 1st pass these; they're holding up pages 13-31, believe it or not.  I could only build decent workspaces in 102, so use that.  I'm just getting to 32-34, as Margaret's Bach stuff was taking me for quite a ride!  
	Your text in the files looks great!  Laying out the text is part of my job, so no worries about that.  I know what you mean about new challenges.  I've been editing this quartet stuff and the editor becomes a whole new problem-generator.. some things are much easier than the piano stuff, some things are a disaster.  :)  I will get to your specific questions about them in the next few days.  
	Please let me know when you start on these pages, I know you may not be able 'drop everything'.  Talk to you soon.  

Ben

Hi Jayne, 

	I think we should stick to 87 in all possible circumstances.  I have trouble putting the copyright notice in a file in 102, and crashes are frequent.  I assume you were just 'test driving' 102, which would be fine if I could send what you 1st-pass to Gary, but that build is just too buggy for now.  Stick to 87 and 100, let me know if there are problems.


Thanks, 
Ben

Hi Jayne,

	The only reasons I push 87 are 1)it is the most stable build we have; less 'undetectable' bugs ie less problems we have to get the programmer's assistance in solving and 2) we can post to the website with 87 & 100, but not with 103 yet.  The latest viewer is 102, I believe, so 103 files will remain in the 'queue' (is that how you spell this word?).  103 is fine, just use 87 or 100 whenever possible.  The short cuts are nice, though, I agree.

Hi Jayne,

	The highest build used to SAVE a file is the one you will have to use to finish.  This is the problem causing the 'illegal action' as far as I can tell, unless gun running, smuggling, or actions of government are related.  ;)  Please please please stick to 87, unless otherwise indicated.  This gives us more flexibility in debugging the pages -- more builds to try.  Each build seems to have it's own strengths and weaknesses; a fix in one build could lead to a bug, an otherwise working feature, in another.  Thanks.

Hi Jayne,

I'm going to use 104c for awhile; it works great for me.  I guess you guys may have some trouble.  I would say use it until you get frustrated, and go to a previous build. Let me know of errors as detailed as poss. so I can pass them on to the programmers!  Thanks.

These are both in accents, being two separate marks.  They are combined to form one accent.

For now we have to build one with graphic/line tool and text.  Leave these blank until further notice.

Hi,

	Try reinstalling the build you are using, restarting, then reloading from CD.  The program sometimes corrupts itself (believe it or not), so this is sometimes necessary.  Thanks!

Hi Jayne,

	I'm finally able to edit your stuff!!!  105g seems to handle all the confusing endings/repeats and grace notes.  With that in mind, I want to address all the questions you had at the time and any follow-up discussion which might happen.  Please take the time to look at these files again while you read my answers, even though you may know all these things already! ;)

This is fine.  When I go through and final edit, I try to standardize the text within the file, which didn't necessarily happen in the original!  For example, all section texts (intro, coda etc) are 42pt, everything else WITHIN THE MUSIC is 24pt.

>

>Syt 5, meas 6, staff 2. Plays behind, how do I fix this, this has happened
>before to me?
The dotted measure line is separate from any barline.  You have to use a graphic (dotted line) and align it with the barline in question.  So you see, there are two barlines and a graphic within these systems.
	If there are the same amount of bars on separate staves within a system, the formatter assumes that they are occuring at the same time, yet are disconnected.  This is used all the time in larger scores to highlight a certain family of instruments (eg the woodwinds are barred together, separate from the rest of the orchestra) or to differentiate all the different families (especially percussion, keyboard, and strings).  
	Take a look at the finished version of p.33 I attached.



>
>File 34- In the errors< Note above and below list doesn't equal it's stem,
>could not fix, there were a few.
This is best solved by redrawing the pesky notes/chords.  It's a bug that should be fixed by now.

Same with this!

Try to edit it in 105g, while we're on the topic.  If it doesn't work, send me another email and we'll see if Brent can do anything with it.

Could you rephrase this?  I'm not sure what you mean by "...I had to reload the rms file to complete it, if I tried the mrw file it would crash."

It's hard to say.  I would lean in the direction of the program being at fault.  There are various random links (voice icons to anything, for example) that take an unusual amount of time to connect.

This is the faulty formatting mechanism in the editor: it IS working 'correctly', in that it's formatting the slurs, but the way it formats them is wrong.  I know how you feel!  I have to tweak them all by hand!  Just let it format them for now, and we'll see how the next build looks; it may fix everything automatically!  Be sure to link them, though, and don't worry about tweaking them; when I run the formatter, all the tweaking will be replaced by the 'formatted' slur.  ;)

I'm not sure waht you mean.  Do you leave the time signatures that appear in the .raw files?  YES  Do you delete any others?  YEP!

You mean changed the event lists to 'notated time'?  In the appropriate measures?  I hope that's the case, because I don't understand what you're saying!!!  :):)  Lemme know.

Hmmm..  I hadn't thought that you might be considering that option.  NO, all grace notes are linked to the NON-grace note before it.  Five 16th note grace notes are all linked to the quarter note preceding, for example, and NOT to each other.

Isn't that a pain!?!?!?!  It's a bug in 106d, not our fault.  Expect it in the future until 107 is out.

Hello Ilir,

	Yes, I've received your past few messages, but only just today!  You see, I've been quite busy with school and haven't been in to work in about a week (I'm so lucky this can happen!), so hello!  Tell me about the situation there, and give me your interpretation of the events there.  As you might know, the news here tends to puff up the news into cute pink bunnies for the people to consume, so I feel I have a skewed view by default.  (Sorry for my cynical banter, but the news really does suck here!)  My sympathies to any hardships you may be enduring, directly or indirectly.  
	Yes, I am very interested in this collaboration we discussed. For such a thing to really happen, we may need to speak over the telephone, if possible.   Perhaps you are planning to begin this when you get here, but these are my feelings if you wish to begin immediately:

	1) We should, for ourselves, decide upon some external boundaries for this, such as instrumentation and length.  I have a computer piece (all manipulated pre-recorded sound) which I've begun, so perhaps I can transfer it's ideas  to live performers and we can discuss this?  Let me know your thoughts.
	2) Lately I've been studying the filmmaker Andrej Tarkovsky, and have been attempting to emulate his ideas in my latest composition.  Any prevailing influences right now?  Let me know.
	3) Hmmm. I sound so stiff!  I'm not really this uptight sounding, honestly, but I tend to write formally.

	Let me know any methods you may want to use for collaboration.  Make a tape of ideas, and I'll do the same?  When are you planning on coming to America?   Where will you be going?  Talk to you soon.

This sounds excellent.  Please forward the info!

My piece is done, and I quite happy with it.  The performers are difficult to get together, so I'm afraid I must wait until summer to hear it.  Is the mail reliable there?  I would like to send you a score and a letter.  Let me know.

I can't emphasize my sympathy.  If there is anything I can do, let me know.

Hi Prof. Bernard,

	I saw this website posted to a post-classical newsgroup.  I thought you might pass it along to any post-tonal theory folks you are teaching this quarter.  At the site, you can rotate the set around a graphical mod twelve clock and play the tones back. (it's a java applet program - you need netscape to run it)  Talk to you soon.

Yes, I do have quite a few Chopin pieces.  They're on the first CD I was sent.  I received no word on what to do with them; they were given to me to train with, after which I was assigned first-passers.  I have them; just assign them to Miriam/Jennifer or whomever.  Sorry again about my mess up!

Hi Jill,

	I've been thinking about our last talk about my position, when I was moved to full-time.   I think October is too long for me to wait for a review, in light of the fact that my position has changed from part- to full-time and my year aniversary is in May.  
	I'd like a platform on which to renegotiate my salary, since my job location and duties have changed tremendously since my last review/pay increase, in September.  Thanks.

Hi Jill,

Here's the situation with the builds now, as I see it:

118f: Good for nearly everything, though formatting is a little sketchy in certain situations i.e. slur formatting.

118i: Good as far as I can see, save the formatter.  Formatting with this build is all but impossible; the measures come out with incongruent widths.  I tried shifting back and forth between i and f, but I feel it takes more time than it's worth.  I should underscore the fact that until the formatter works, I can't finish AND test simultaneously. I've spoken to Lorick and logged the bug, but haven't heard that it's been fixed yet..

118d: the most stable thing going.  Though the lyric wizard is a bit unreliable, in some situations, it's the main fault of d.  I still have to go back to it in order to do what f refuses to!  

Thought an update might be in order..

Hi Jill,

	Sorry.  I didn't realize the rigidity of this schedule.  I stayed late on Monday to make up for Tues, and should have emailed you telling you so.  Sorry for blowing that.  Can I say simply '5 hrs' on Tues and Thurs?  At times, I need to pop into school on the way to work on Tues and Thurs, so a little flexibility would be nice.  I guess I'm being unrealisitic with '7' on MWF, so let me know if this is acceptable:

MWF: 8-6
T TH: 5 hrs
Weekend: pick up slack if necessary.

	I can make 40 hrs. without a problem, but I depend on the flexibility of the job since I'm still in school, though very infrequently these days.  Should we talk or is this sufficient?

Hi Jill and Mary,

	On point four, "you will be compensated for April 10":

	I believe it was 8 hrs of sick time, and I saw no mention of sick time on my last two checks.  Did it end up with the normal hours?  I couldn't find where, but this might me my mistake.

Thanks!

Hi,

	118i has a horrible foramtting bug that makes it pretty much unuseable.  Shall I switch back and forth between i and an earlier build, or can I just go back?  Thanks! It's bug# 3782/3783, BTW.

Hi Jill,

	So here's the bug we were discussing at today's meeting.  I think it's pretty much fixed.  118o will likely be the one to release to everyone, since bug 3762 is holding us back.  Lorick knows this already, incidentally.

Hi Jill,

	I've been working with Donald Craig at the School of Music Computer Center at the U of W fo about a year.  We've been studying two programming languages used in sound production, and he's surpassed everyone in the class (20 people) in terms of his skill with the language.  He's the type of guy who will stay after his works done to help others (this came in REALLY handy around finals!), which I admire in anyone.  Hire him quick! ;)

I would say cancel.  The easy tab, in my opinion, isn't worth the time.   There is simply a presentation of the vocal melody and it's tab equivalent.

Hi Jessica,

	I didn't check all of them, bu the Rach. Elegy files aren't first passed.  Gary said a little while ago that if we couldn't work with the file Tacoma formatted, we should get the original page files.  I assume there are some that are first-passed.  Could you let me know?

I think it would be appropriate to have session to

1) present new name ideas for ProConArt, as well as related topics (publicity etc)

2) Discuss ASCAP and BMI membership, and any related topics (if any).

I am still trying to get percussionists together for my piece.  It is recital time for many of them, so reaction has been lukewarm at best.  If I have a tape  by next Friday, I will present then.  Is it ok if it isn't exactly a 'polished' performance (I may only get them for a read-through).  Sorry for the tardiness, but recruiting the performers has been goin on for three weeks, to no avail! Thanks!

No, No need to evacuate, though I can see lees changing her mind at the last minute.  I'll be by about 4:00 today, to get her truck, so maybe we can talk more then..  my work number is in my signature at the end..

Nope I sure don't.  We need to get ahold of him....  I'll try Laura and I think  she'll have it..  Kim called and said she might be able to come, but said she was goin to wild ginger (so you haven't gotten ahold of her eh)..  No number on her message..  I don't think we should worry too much about her, since she sounded more on the down side..  Gimme a call, it's way to busy to do this on the email.. :)

Sunhawk Evaluation - October 1997

Instructions
Answer each question inline using a Word Processor (WordPad or MS-Word).
Each answer should normally be no longer than  page.  Submit this report
by E-mail to your supervisor.  Please keep this evaluation form
confidential.  You should take approximately 2 hours to fill out this form

NAME: Ben McAllister

POSITION: Senior Music Editor

DATE: 9-24-97

SUPERVISOR: Gary Martin


What do you like best about your job?
Working at home and being able to guide my 1st-passers in the way I see fit.  I also like the quick responses I get to programming issues.

What do you like least about your job?
The lag in response to nearly all communications over email.  Oftentimes I find myself asking a question for the third time, sometimes within the body of an email, only to have it ignored in the response to that email.  I also feel I am underpaid for the skills I put to use on the job.
 
How well do you think you are performing at your job?
I am performing my job to the best of my ability.  I've organized and maintained my 'staff' of 1st-passers with little or no assistance, which I had no experience doing prior to my position here.  In addition, I've consistently produced quick, high quality work.

Do you feel you are given sufficient tools, training and support to get
your job done?
Usually.  The email is the main hold-up.  The only other tool/training I feel I need is possibly with excel, so I may track the status of files better.  Additionally, the central web directories for files will be a great help.

What do you like most about your supervisor?
Gary's experience in publishing can be a great aid.  Also, he is more organized than I, and I get useful tips from him.

What do you like least about your supervisor?
Many times, the emails I send aren't completely answered; it seems often they are read hurriedly.

How does the distributed or virtual organization of Sunhawk help you do
your job?
Efficiency is kept high.  The different lists (editsun, finish) help the exchange of ideas along.  Also, I can concentrate on the music better with no one else around!

How does the distributed or virtual organization of Sunhawk hinder your
ability to do your job?
I don't feel it hinders my job.

What are your long term goals with Sunhawk?
To continue to keep the music flowing, and maintain print notation's place in musician's lives.  I look forward to taking part in the release of new music, as well as getting some under-published works from this century a broader audience.  I would like, eventually, to split my time between editing newer works and archiving works from the modern rep.

What could be changed that would improve our efficiency as a team and company?
More staff meetings and communication in general.  It all helps: the status reports Gary puts out, the meetings, lunches with Judy and Brent; everything.  Another slot person would help, obviously, and less confusion sent from Tacoma would help.

Do you feel your suggestions are taken seriously and implemented?
Not always.  The only time I feel they are taken seriously is when they are implemented--they aren't always acknowledged.  I feel there is too much ego involved in many people's jobs, and suggestions are often misinterpreted as criticism.

What should we do to make this review process smoother?
This is fine... I guess we'll see how the review goes!  

Thank-you for taking the time to fill out this form.
You are indeed most welcome.

Hi Judy,

	As of tonight, all three O'Morrison tunes are edited as far as I can get them, but bugs hold them back from being completely formatted.  Lorick has word that they need to be debugged ASAP, so I'm waiting for him. 
	Also, in 'If Money is the Root of...", there are some possible misprints.  Should I ask you questions to ask the composers, or do we just go with what's on the page?  Thanks.

Hi,

	When I'm done with a guitar piece, what's the procedure?  
	1) Who slots? Me?
	2) If I slot, do I just send the filename and info to Harry?  I assume you, Marlin, want to check out the first few pieces, but I'm not sure if you're actually slotting or not.
	
Thanks,

Hi,

	Check this out and let me know if it's still too small.  Note the large 'blobs'.

Hi,

	Should I do another Christian Music transcription or stick with guitar stuff?

Hi Judy,

	Two things:

	1)  The two attached text files contains catalog entries from the Univ. of California database.  They are ALL out of copyright, and about 95% look like they would sell well; particularly the Tarrega.  Most of these are relatively hard-to-find pieces.

	2)  Heather (the newer one) recently found a Hawaiian guitar method and sent it off to be scanned.  I would like to first-pass and finish these, since I have a few ideas about making a small "hawaiian guitar method" out of the few instructional sheets in the book.  The pieces in that book are pretty hard-to-find as well.  

Thanks!

Did you ever send me file names?  I can just go ahead and do the Greensleeves from Noad's book, but I think Canon in D would be quite a time consuming job.  You tell me.

Hi,

	I'll be finishing (knock on wood) this Van Halen solo tomorrow.  Do you want me to continue with Guitar stuff I've sourced, do another Warner guitar tune, or do what everyone else is doing (Berlin, I think)? See you tomorrow.

Hi Judy and Marlin,

	How do you think we should sell this Hawaiian guitar stuff?  We need to tell the people to use a slide, retune, and play in a certain style on each sheet.  
	I suggest that we make up some sort of style sheet to sell on the guitar catalog webpage, which would guide the player through these and give them a clearer idea of how they should be played.  Otherwise, I think we'll spend ample time adding this info. to the individual pieces.  ?  Thanks.

Hi Judy,

	I just wanted to let you know that the recognized files I got today are pretty much worthless.  I can't get the tab to work with anything, and I logged the appropriate bugs.  I'm manually entering a few of these, then I'll continue with the Warner stuff, OK?  Thanks.

Hi Judy,

	I just wanted to let you know where I'm at with the guitar catalog.

	I have 12 Hawaiian pieces complete, but they crash the viewer presently.  I'm waiting to check them in the new build before I pass them to slot.
	I've been working for some time trying to get my latest Warner tune going, but too many bugs stand in the way.  I'm going to go ahead and grab a baton from Ian's desk and do a tune or two.  Then, I'll grab another warner tune which I CAN do in this build.  Probably the Batman book Warner sent us.  If we want to arrange any of these, can we?  Talk to you tomorrow.

We figured out that the two missing ones were held up by bugs we'd uncovered way back when.  I fixed one and just sent it to Rick -- It only took a half an hour in 106d!  Amazing..  The other is a page formatting issue that I'll (knock on wood) fix today.  At any rate they'll be over and done with today.

Hi Judy,

	I'm having to rebuild the pages (In some cases, without the recognizer) since the scans are pretty much worthless; the rms's we get are really bug-ridden.  Keep in mind I have to first-pass them too.  I'll (fingers-crossed) have dark wind of missouri done today, and finish the rest this week.  I only got 20 hours in last week, and so spent only 7 hours on them so far.

Hey Judy,

	OK, here goes.  Sorry if it's not 'quick'.  :)

	They're all in 'If Money is the root of all evil':

	p.2, sys 7:  At this point in the lyric, they split evil 'ev-il', as opposed to 'e-vil'.  Is this on purpose?  It occurs several times in each manner - if it didn't I would assume it was a typo.

	p.2 sys 1, meas 3:  he puts the 'word'  "kissme" under one note.  I want to know if this is definitely correct.  It, also, occurs a few times.

	p.2, sys 1, meas 5; sys 4, meas 5; sys 8, meas 4; sys 8, meas 5: They have weird intervals for notes, predominately a second.  These are the only harmonies in the piece and really out of character harmonies for the style.  I want to confirm them, as well.

	These also occur a few times on page 3.

	I'll be home at 11am tomorrow if any of this needs clarification.  Thanks, and the work is no problem.  :)

BTW: all three tunes are held up by bugs.  I asked Brent what to do, he referred me to Lorick, and this is the last I've heard.  Should we apply more heat ;) or wait a bit?

Hi Judy,

	Yeah, but I'm waiting for debugging from Cam.  I can't get it to format complete.  There's no workaround, either...  That I can find at least.  :)

Hi Judy,

	We (Jessica and I) sent the newer Jessica (glasses, dark hair) to the library with some suggetions, particularly Stravinsky.  She came back with them, and they're here/being scanned already.  I would like to see most of them on the site, but they ain't kids stuff or guitar!!  ;)  

	I talked to a friend of mine (Novacek's #1 student and manager of 'the Rosewood Guitar' in the u dist) about out of copyright sources, and he said most of the 2nd editions (editions printed since the original) of this Sor, Giuliani, etc stuff was only in private collections.  The only public source he could give me was the Portland Guitar Society -- are we in touch with them?  Also, the 'collectors' are reachable, are they not?  Is there an index anywhere of these people and what they have?

You should not slot your own stuff. It is good to get another set of
eyeballs on the piece even if the other set is not a guitarist. You are
correct is assuming that I want to keep an eye on the first few tunes that
go out so you can just email them to me when you think they're done."

	So, I guess I'll have Craig subslot and leave it at that?  There's another problem: no raws.  Unless I can xerox pieces from the book, I'm going to have to coordinate times with Craig when the book will be free.  Let me know which I should do.

Thanks.

Hi Judy,

	Filenames?  Thanks.  Incidentally, there's an arrangment of Greensleeves  in Noad's book.  It's a pretty straightforward one ie probably nothing Noad could lay personal claim to.  I assume we'll use that one.  I'll try to figure out the filename from Glenda or Harry and get back to you on the Canon. (gross!)

Did you ever send me file names?  I can just go ahead and do the Greensleeves from Noad's book, but I think Canon in D would be quite a time consuming job.  You tell me.

Hi Judy,

	A good idea.. I think we're talking about the same thing.  I'll continue 
with the pieces and wait for Jessica to get the Hawaiian book back from the library..  THEN I'll get the style sheet made up.

Hi,

Pros:
1) Decent looking notation.
2) Qualified (on paper)
3) High energy, maybe a little OVERzealous

Cons:
1) Had no idea what we did!!!!!
2) Felt the need to tell me, when speaking of his playing, "I'm not a very good reader". (?)  This, at least, emphasized to me that he REALLY didn't know what we did.
3) Didn't offer much explanation of his experience/background i.e. no anecdotes, little mention of specific jobs/events he'd participated in.  This is when I asked him, by the way.  

In all, I have to agree with Judy on her two points.  I say thumbs down, just on the lack of common sense (no idea what our company did, didn't offer a whole lot on himself, save his computer experience).  Is it fair to expect the person to know what we do?  I definitely think so.

>THE LYRIC WIZARD
>================
>
>Design Goals
>------------
>1) Make it easier to enter lyrics and assign them to notes
>2) Make the process of changing lyrics less error prone
>3) Automatically handle hyphenation and underlining in lyrics.
>
>Steps
>-----
>1) Text Entry
>2) Automatic Note Assignment
>3) Manual Note Assignment
>
>Step 1 - Text Entry
>-------------------
>
>Enter the entire line of lyrics as usual.  Use the hyphen (-) character to
>indicate where you would like to hyphenate between syllables.  These
>syllables will then be linked to different notes.  Use the underscore (_)
>character to indicate that you would like an underline to follow the text
>underneath all the notes the text is linked to.  Note that the underscore
>stuff isn't implemented just yet
>
>For example, suppose you type in the following:
>
>Oh I come from Al-a-bam-a with a Gui-tar on my knee
>
>It will assign the lyrics to notes as follows:
>
>*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
>Oh   I  come  from  Al - a - bam - a   with  a  Gui - tar  on    my  knee
>
>Or (once underlining is implemented), you could enter the following text:
>
>Glo_r-ia!  In ex-cel-sius de_-o
>
>It will look something like the following:
>
>*    ****   *  ****  *  ****  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *   *   *
>Glo____________________________ - ri - a!  In   ex - cel - sius de____ -o
>
>IMPORTANT NOTE:  When you use the "AutoHyphen" and "AutoUnderline" features,
>the hyphens and underlines will be adjusted automagically as you reposition
>or reformat the lyrics in the score.  The program will automagically add or
>remove extra hyphen characters as needed to fill out the space between lyrics.
>
>The way this all happens is determined by the Lyric Object Type.  When the

>If you wanted to override this, you could change the object type from
>"Trailing AutoHyphen Lyric" back to "Normal Lyric".  In this case, the
>hyphen character will be drawn normally.
>
>Step 2 - Automatic Note Assignment
>----------------------------------
>
>Pick the starting note for the lyrics.  The program will then use space,
>hyphen (-) and underscore (_) characters to break the text into individual
>lyrics.  These lyrics will be created and automatically assigned to notes.
>
>IMPORTANT NOTE:  You should have a reasonably Song Render before you run the
>Lyric Wizard.  This will help it determine which notes to link the Lyrics to.
>
>Step 3 - Manual Note Assignment
>-------------------------------
>
>If the lyrics were improperly linked to notes after step 2, you can correct

>
>1) Create a new solo score

Hi,

	We spoke for a bit at the beginning of the summer, and you wanted me to touch base with you before the comp. audition next Friday.  We were speaking, among other things, about helping me reduce the comp lesson requirement, since I am due to graduate with a Bachelor's in Music Theory this quarter as it is.  In case you don't remember me, I remember you saying "you're using weird Frank Zappa time sigs and reading Xenakis books, so you must be a little farther along than a Freshman".  Maybe that will ring a bell.  
	I've finished a few brief pieces and one string quartet over the summer, scored two short films, and am recording the string quartet I wrote next week (fingers crossed).  Do you want to take a look, or shall I just show up?  I was hoping to speak with you again about the possibility of reducing the lesson requirement for the sake of clarification; I think we spoke of perhaps halving it.  I'm definitely committed to studying comp, whatever the outcome.

Thanks,

Ben

Hi,

	Just a reminder about the Xenakis book.  Also, if you have any 'landscapey' you might point me to, that you wouldn't mind lending me a cd of, I'd appreciate it.  I'm trying to feel this one out with long walks through my neighborhood with my tape recorder running, but have little idea of the state of structure in these kinds of pieces.  ?  Thanks and see ya tomorrow.

				then go swimming, bbqing, etc!(my house)

	August 8 - Sept 6 app.	Rehearsals - possibly Sunday evenings?
				All take place in Seattle

Hi Kathy, 

	I got your email address from Michael Brockman.  I am kind of in a biond and need a tenor/bari player for a piece of mine, to be performed on Sept 10.  Rehearsals are every Wednesday in the Music bldg until then, starting tonight.  I realize this is short notice, but I'd appreciate any help you can lend.  Obviously, I wouldn't expect you to show tonight, but if you can next week on, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.  Feel free to give me a call at home (364-4651)or work (below).

I didn't realize there were additional extensions/libraries (? not sure what this means in this context) to install, for the manual's setup section doesn't mention any.  THanks!

Thanks for getting back to me.  I could get it into some sort of web format, but can't promise anything like that until July.   Studies are winding to a halt and I have lots of things to finish before June 15!  I am definitely interested though and will drop you something ASAP.  Please let me know a bit more about the setting the music will be in, so I can prepare something appropriate.  Thanks.

The main road of Kosova which connects capitol Prishtine (East) to
town Peje (West) is blocked by the police and paramillitary forces.
There are roumors that heavy fighting occured yesterday but this
is not confirmed yet. 

The villages in Drenica region (central kosova), Decani and Gjakova
region (west - near the Albania border) are attacked, bombarded 
continuosly. The totla amount of police and army forces has been
trippled during last week. It is feared that a combined major police 
and army operation will happen during next weeks in all these regions.

Serbian students have barikaded themselves in university buildings
to not alow albanian students enter. They have threated any albanian
who enters will be beaten... 
This is the true face of 21`st century generation of "intelectuals"

>are the only group to have maintained peace in the region for the past ten

>nationalistic Albanians clamoring for separatism. It began with attempts to
>re-instate national and international law in their province. It was a partial
>attempt to address the dire economic and social problems in the province of
>Kosova.
>Before "peace" negotiations even begin, the Kosovars should have the
>conditions of their 1974-89 autonomy reinstated--a stage of the slowly
>evolving statehood intrinsic to the Yugoslav constitution at that time. That
>should be the starting point of the talks, not the predetermined end point.
>The so-called Republic of Kosova resulted not from an irresponsible, hyper-
>nationalistic public but was created step-by-step in an effort to retain the
>Kosvoars fast-eroding basic human and legal rights. The Federal Republic of
>Yugoslavia, on paper, at least, had made careful efforts to protect its
>minority populations within its international borders( Woodwar, Balkan
>Tragedy). When these legal safeguards were trampled on, chaos and fear became
>rampant throughout all the minorities.

>Bear with me. I will be as brief as possible. (For the long version, read Noel

>
>It is accepted as common knowledge by now that the illegal revocation of the
>Kosovar's provincial parliament in 1989/90 was a manipulation by Milosevic to
>consolidate and centralize power in Belgrade at the expense of both Voyvodia
>and Kosova. At that same time, Serb nationalist rhetoric calling the Albanians
>"terrorists" and "separatists" became standard propaganda belched out daily by
>the State-controlled media.
>In 1989, the  Serb parliament passed a series of "special measures," laws that
>severely restricted the Kosovar's autonomous provincial laws, giving
>centralized control over nearly all aspects of society to Belgrade, going so
>far as to assign an "official" language to the region. Under the existing
>constitution, these special measures had to yet be accepted by the Kosova
>assembly. therein lay the problem.
>Seeing what was coming, the Albanians, led by the miners of Trepca, organized
>the first of their mass demonstrations of protest, urging the reversal of
>these intentionally discriminatory policies. The stated goal of these protests
>was "No retreat from the fundamental principles of the 1974 constitution."
>(Malcolm, p. 343.) The Serb propaganda, in order to fan the flames of
>nationalism, labeled these demonstrators "separatists," and "terrorists."
>To put down the protests, Serb troops arrived and the crackdowns began. One
>thousand ethnic Albanian dissenters, intellectuals,officials, and protesters
>were arrested and accused of separatism. Two hundred were placed in solitary
>confinement (Malcolm, p.345.) All were beaten and to some degree tortured.
>At a meeting on July 2, 1990, the Kosovar Albanian assembly members voted to
>declare Kosova "an equal and independent entity within the framework of the
>Yugoslav federation." (Malcolm, p. 346). Again, at this point despite the
>widespread presence of tanks and special police, the Kosovar's intent was to
>end violence and discrimination, not to create separatism. Yes, they felt
>increasingly nationalistic, but no they did not seek a kind of ethnically-
>cleansed mini-state.
>Hopefully this attempt to maintain lawfulness in the face of disorder shows
>the Kosova is not "everyman's ethnic mini-state," which is the American
>justification for not assisting in preventing the slide into apartheid which
>followed. What was at issue for the Kosovars was the abrupt abridgement of law
>and order (see Human Rights Watch, 1993) as well as the end to their
>representative government.
>Dictators and totalitarianism are destabilizing and threaten surrounding
>states, not a population demanding the return on their basic human rights.
>Persecution and violence in Kosova continued, including the displacement of
>Albanian families especially along the borders. Serb officials told Human
>Rights Watch interviewers that under Serb measures, dissenters can be
>arrested, tortured, and even killed for alleged "terrorist activities." (Open
>Wounds, 1993).
>In 1990, Serb parliament passed the discriminatory laws in employment and
>abolished the educational system (Open Wounds, p. 107). They began to hire
>Serbs and Montenegrins to replace the 80,000 dismissed Albanians. Because
>under Serb law, those fired from a job do not qualify for either health care
>or welfare benefits, the long slow exodus of Albanian men (approx. 350,000)
>began in earnest.
>Human rights observers were dismissed from the region in 1993 and
>maltreatment increased sharply. Never forget that even now, the population is
>fifty per cent children under the age of 15. It is them, hte women, and the

>Coming back one at a time. 
>At this point in 1990, the Yugoslav Republic--or what butchered version was

>flared as republics seceded, and polarized, ethnic language was cemented into

>They called it The Republic of Kosova and protected the rights of minorities

>
>Serbia was now in violation not only of its own national laws but of

>access to legal counsel and a fair trial

>> 
>> New York - The Yugoslav National Army (JNA) and Serbian special police 
>> forces are committing violations of humanitarian law in Kosovo, Human 
>> Rights Watch stated today.  Attacks on civilians and the systematic 
>> destruction of villages have effectively cleansed Kosovo's western 
>> region of ethnic Albanians.  Human Rights Watch has strong evidence of 
>> summary executions and rape.
>> 
>>         At the same time, the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA) has 
>> detained at least thirty Serb civilians and allegedly forced many 
>> others from their homes.  As the conflict continues, abuses by the KLA 
>> seem to be increasing.
>> 
>>         Human Rights Watch recently completed a four-week fact-finding 
>> mission in Kosovo and Northern Albania.  A detailed report will be 
>> published soon, but some of the preliminary findings include:
>> 
>> *        Powerful evidence that Serbian police forces summarily 
>> executed ethnic Albanians in the villages of Likosane and Cirez (Feb. 
>> 28-March 1), Prekaz (March 5-6), Poklek (May 31), and Ljubenic (May 
>> 30).  Eyewitnesses report the rape of three women in Ljubenic.
>> 
>> *        The JNA and Serbian special police have fired on civilians 
>> fleeing their homes in the western region, including those attempting 
>> to cross the border into Albania.  Helicopters marked with the red 
>> cross have shot at refugees near the Albanian border on at least two 
>> occasions in early June.
>> 
>> *        A large number of ethnic Albanians have been detained 
>> throughout Kosovo over the past two months.  The precise number is 
>> impossible to determine because Serbian officials do not disclose the 
>> names or locations of those taken into custody.  Doctor Hafir Shala 
>> has been missing since April 10, when he was taken into custody by the 
>> police near Slatina.  Zahrida Podrimcaku, a local human rights 
>> activist, was arrested in Prishtina on June 8, one hour after speaking 
>> with a Human Rights Watch researcher, and charged with committing 
>> terrorist acts.
>> 
>> *        Access is still severely restricted in the western area of 
>> Kosovo for journalists and humanitarian aid organizations.  Aside from 
>> blocking much needed food and medical supplies, restricted access 
>> prevents outside experts from investigating human rights violations, 
>> including allegations of a mass detention center in the Dekor company 
>> near Decan and a possible mass grave in the nearby forest.
>> 
>>         The international community has issued strong statements but 
>> failed to apply the pressure that would convince President Slobodon 
>> Milosevic to stop his abusive campaign.  With Serbian forces  
>> beginning what looks like a major offensive near Obilic, it is 
>> critical for the United States and the international community to 
>> exert strong and sustained pressure on the Yugoslav leadership.  
>> Non-military options include: the economic isolation of Milosevic and 
>> Yugoslavia's military establishment and full financial and logistical 
>> support for the War Crimes Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia, whose 
>> mandate covers Kosovo.
>> 
>>         At the same time, the international community should condemn 
>> the increasing number of  humanitarian law violations committed by the 
>> Kosova Liberation Army (KLA).  Human Rights Watch has documented some 
>> violations, including detentions of and attacks on Serbian civilians, 
>> as well as the KLA siege of Kijevo, which effects civilians and other 
>> non-combatants in the town.  Since Kosovo is an internal armed 
>> conflict, both government forces and the KLA are obliged to respect, 
>> at a minimum, the provisions of Common Article 3 of the Geneva 
>> Conventions, which require that civilians and other protected persons 
>> be treated humanely, with specific prohibitions on murder, torture, or 
>> cruel, humiliating or degrading treatment.

I may be able to steal a few stands out of the bass closet.  I'll be there at 7:15, k?  All my additional players are flakin on this first rehearsal, with varying quality in the excuses.  Are all rehearsals going to be structured this way? (20 min per piece?)  See yez.

Yep, I did already put word out.  The deal is this: Greg said at the last rehearsal that a week from tomorrow was no prob, so I moved everyone to that date.  Jim (Bass cl from Bellingham) and Jason V. (Perc 2) and Lorick (sax) had said they couldn't make it tomorrow, which is the reason we switched to next week.  Basically, we've got Greg, Chris and the pianist tomorrow.  (My vibes player took a gig, thinking there was no rehearsal.)  Do you think it's worth it to run through it with only three people? I dunno. I did put an email out asking everyone be prepared, I guess we'll see how bad it is next week! :)

Two rehearsals ago, you and Sarah said that since I wasn't being rehearsed until tomorrow (26th) that I would get extra time at that rehearsal.  I'm just reminding you.  Don't know why you didn't get that; it didn't bounce back...

Seen Richard at all lately?  Is he outa town?

Hey and thanks to you.  You really deserve the credit for getting it together -- I really appreciate you giving it a shot w/the stick!  Richard of course couldn't wait two seconds before giving me a full critique (in the aisle of the church) which was kinda funny.   Lab 'n' smoke this week?  Thurs?  Thanks again.

That sucks about the CD.  I think I could live with a cassette, but a cd is probably better... I can bring a cd in Thurs. if you're game.  :)  Could you bring my Score on thurs?  We made a couple of changes that I want to update in the process of totally overhauling the piece!

:):)  No, he really didn't say anything specific...  I think all the ideas in there are too difficult to get out the way they are, and they go by too fast anyway..  I think I'm just going to stretch things out a bit and leave it at that.  What do you think?

Yay you are awesome.  We can get you going on some flute stuff quick.  Lots of Debussy that you would like. 

Yep music's pretty multi-dimensional.  I feel useless right now because I've been studying it for so long with so little playing time.  I guess summer will change that.  I'm glad you want to play.. it is awesome therapy.  People do talk about boring shit alot, but I think it's because they don't know any better.  Watch what happens when I start going into detail about what I'm doing in a piece or at this job... 99% of the people I talk to about it either check out and go 'cool' or start laughing becausee I sound so 'serious'..  It's weird.  I guess that's why I like the geeky friends I have at scholl.  At least I can talk about stuff with them and they will take it seriously (somewhat).

If you want to get a movie tonight I will have time,  because I'm going to start the paper now, which will give me enough time to finish if I work today and tomorrow on it.  See, I already know most of what I'm going to say, so it's not such a big deal.  :)  Also any little treats or little drinks would be appreciated.  See you when you get home.

That sounds good.  I have been away from my 4track for so long I could die.  Next week is going to be half work, half that, I think.  The guy from work who interviewed me (the uptight one) came over this morning and installed a NICE printer!  He was nice too.  It was nice.
Oh by the way, Yous gave me some Zinc tabs, so I'm good.  I feel a little bit better today.  I hope you aren't getting it...it would suck if you had it this weekend.  
So you can listen to realaudio stuff at work?  There's this thing called "ten toes radio" that's supposed to be all lo-fi music.  It's kinda funny, because it's mostly dorks with four tracks or computers, but about 2/3 of it is annoying so you want to fast forward.  I'll email the address when I get on it again.

Leesa:

	Hey the email is benmca@oz.net.  I tried to listen to the show from last night but it kept cutting out and rebuffering or whatever.  I won't chicken out about the haircuts, don't worry.  I wonder if we'll be freaked to go out in public after?

	I did listen to a little bit of the show until it got too annoying and they start saying all this stuff about the Egyptian government that is pretty interesting.  The gov't apparently is suppressing alot of research findings there.  Weird.

	The Arizona thing has a link on Art's page, but the photos are real small and just look blobby.  I'm listening to the show now.. lots of 19.5 on the day Dick H. thinks the Mars thing'll disappear.  Cool eh.
	The email should be at the top of this message.
	I will call that place pronto. No name?  Thanks for grabbing it.  Call people to invite this weekend!!! I've been saying 4:00.. do you think that's cool?

Ok that would be cool.  I have to get something done for sunhawk AND for the movie soon or my self-esteem will go negative.  I talked to Scott about this stuff this morning and he has the same situation with Erica; "I love hanging out with her but if I don't get anything done, it's like I get sad or something."  By the way he said good morning biggie this morning.  :(
Oh well.

Hey Lees.  I think everything is much better, with me anyways, than it was yesterday.  I'm a lot more optimistic than before, and I'm real glad you understand where I'm coming from.  It's really hard to fit my lifestyle in with a relationship, and I've never been totally happy with it before. I've always been musically limited because of the relationship I've been in.  This is the first time where it seems that might not be the case.  I love you a lot and want to keep trying.  I'm glad you remember our talks in the past, and that I don't have to repeat myself; it's really draining because now, maybe, you can see how complicated this can get.  I don't really need you to ride me, I need you just to ask me about it I guess. I'm really stoked you like Battlestar Galactica too.  :)  I love ya darlin.

Oh no no details to tell really, just talking about how he's kinda lonely and how our friendship (?) is going.  I tried to suggest he was hard headed sometimes and he KINDA listened.  Of course he got defensive, but I think I got through.  I'm trying not to feed into getting angry and trying to better the Sitch-eee-ashun, so we had a positive talk.

What's 'shall we dance?'?  The other two are cool, I think I'd rather go see pillow book than John Woo but I guess that's my motherly side coming out...  Any are cool.  Wait, you already saw pillow book, right?  I don't know, you pick.

We are going to look at a place by the band house I used to semi-live in, by the grocery store we went to before Golden Gardens the other day.  I'll call if I don't hear from you soon.

Hey baby,

Yep I did get a bunch done last night, but waking up sucked!  I finished the whole thing, sketch-wise, and just need to get it into the computer and make the parts from the score (the mechanical work of it).  Also I found a few other brief things I want to get done before the audition, so I've got a lot to do.  

I love you and hope you get some coffee. Can't Helen w/the big heart or Judy lend ya a buck?

love ben

You are the sweetest woman on earth.  

Man you have to listen to the Art from last night.  The guy is some documentary filmmaker who was doing a documentary on the pyramids/sphinx.  He says all this AMAZING stuff about sound and resonance in the pyramid.  Basically, the theory is that the great pyramid at Giza was once, when the sides were smooth, like a gigantic coke bottle which the wind blew through the top of (make sense?).  It resonates like that stairwell at your work, but with MORE than one note!!!!  He says it makes an F# chord!  Anyway I'll shut up and let you listen but I thought it was really interesting.  

love ben

Sweetie you are so funny.

I'm sorry things have been confusing lately.  I feel so lost lately.  Like I'm grabbing at things in the dark...'oh, composition program is probably what I should do... ok...' That kind of mindset.  So I'm kind of frustrated at not knowing exactly what I should do.  Sorry for making it sound like you had something to do with the problem - it's between me and life, I guess. I love ya alot and don't want you to think otherwise, OK?  I can't wait to see ya tonight.  :)

Good Mooooooooorrrrrning

	Are you having an awesome morning?  I am having an awesome morning.  Awesome man, awesome.  I think I drove out all the bad juju here, cause I had a blast listenin to old stuff of mine (found a few cool things to play you) and made up one cool thing...  I just feel better though, that's the point.  
	I got up at 7 and fixed my bike, so now I'm going to ride to school.  Can you get lunch at 1:30?  At La Vaca?  :)  My treat darlin.  I'll call between 11:30 and 12:30 and see.  
	The Terrance thing is cool.  I think I'm pretty conscious of my 'use' of caffeine, in general, though I do have to check myself every once in awhile and drop it a bit.  I happen to be buzzing this morning (half a latte only!) so I feel a little hypocritical saying this.
	The Ab workout went good?  I hope so.  I forgot to ask you if you found a costume yesterday, but I guess all these and other questions will be answered today, if I see you.  Thanks again for stoppin by last night. I love you.

I forgot to give you the teapot knob,
Ben

Hi sweetiepie.  Yep I'm gonna write new songs, and YOURE singing backups on at least one so don't try and weasel out of it.  If you do, I'll release somethin with you saying "mothuhfuckah!!!" on it from that one time we messed on the fourtrack.  I love ya and can't wait to see you.  Work is actually pretty casual and fun when everyone's here (my buddies, not that Dr. meaner).  So no worries.  I'm not sure what's going on tonight with us getting out there, but I'll call in a bit and maybe I'll know!  Love ben

The extravagant dinner should be something we both like a lot, probably something mexican.  The prob is, we have been eating the kinckinest mexican for the last three days!!  So, I'm kinda at a loss...  How bout the magic torrene?  Or however you spell it.  I would like something Italian and light, I think.  Or, something we haven't tried yet, so I'll take a look at some recipe web things, so you should send me what sites you know of.  Something oriental or no?  What do you think?  
No champagne except maybe one glass so we can be queen and king fancy.  Anna was so funny last night "It's not for keeping warm, it's for fancy."  That was funny.  
Margaritas are a definite.

the more presents thing was a JOKE!!

Hi sweet

	My day is boring as helll but almost over.  You called me yesterday and told me to turn on NPR for the meteor report, remember??  They didn't know anything yet, though.  What didja hear?  I am also stoked for tonight.  I'm kinda bummed 'cuz the guys I work with just told me they both earn $12/hr and I should be paid more than them cause I produce more.  :(  Nothing I can do until Brent and Judy come back...  Tonight will be fun - I can't wait!

love ya

Hey sweetie,

What's up with the insurance?  Did you get an estimate?  Did you get ahold of the perpetrators?  Write back.  I hope you can understand everything!  I love ya.

Hey, I feel a little bit better, but I'm starting to get REALLY tired.  I got a lot of sleep last night, so I'm kinda worried.  Thanks for askin.

As far as Joy goes, she probably has a valid point.  We are both turning a little hermitish, only my friends don't say anything before they WRITE ME OFF FOR GOOD!  You go tonight, if you want.  I totally understand.  In her eyes, 'you just saw him last night', but to you  you're just trying to nurse your sweetie, right?  I'll talk to you later -- I hope you know I'd much rather you come get me than go to Hockey, but we need to maintain our friendships, right?  I love ya.

Oh man...  I would REALLY like to go!!  I COULD swing it, if it wasn't for school....  It's not naive to fantasize my darlin..

Well, she hasn't responded yet, and all she said in her email was "Are you still in a band?  I've been kinda of out of it". Period.  So, I'll let ya know.  More than anything I want to find out if Steph's dad is still alive, because he was due to get some huge sum of money/award type thing in conjunction with the cold fusion people who got it a little while back.  

I love ya and I'm havin a good day for once!  I'll hopefully see you tonight, if I can escape soon..  Love love love

Yep,  just everything went wrong this morning.  And I'm way behind in Arabic again to begin with.  I kinda had another time freakout last night, and stayed up late cleaning my room, since I haven't been around to for awhile. That felt good.  So I slept right through the thing, hitting snooze in my sleep.  Boo.  So, I'm at work listenin to 8tracks and typing in eruption!  It's a little better, but I have like 3 hours of arabic tonight and I feel kinda overwhelmed.  Oh well, what else is new, right?  I love ya sweet.

Yew betcha I wanna go ta dinner.  Man I am having the weirdest morning.  I didn;t eat dinner last night, so maybe that's all that's wrong (I'm eatin now, AND I did have a yogurt and bagel last night before I left work), but I got REALLY dizzy a little bit ago.  Freaky.  Maybe no sleep too! :(  Anyway, I'm gonna come in on Sunday for a bit, so I can leave at 4:30, or sooner if you need, but 4:30 would be prime.  I could just come up and have you drop me off, so...  Lemme know.  I'm listenin to terrance a bit but where are the clues???  You smartie. Loves

I'm real glad she's coming up.  You need it sweet.  As far as Joy goes, I don't think it's unrealistic to expect someone else in your house to buy the basics.  It maybe a little more than she expects to spend on the extras, like pictures, just because I know Matt isn't into that either.  I have to totally prompt him, and most of the time he says he can't afford it anyway. (He actually can't) I would be pissed too, but maybe it's just growing up, and not YOUR problem.  Dig?  It's definitely something you should either confront Joy on or drop your expectations.  I've dropped my expectations.  Guys really could give a shit with that stuff, y'know?  
	Stop emptying the ashtray, too.  THen confront her on that, cause that's a basic.

Loves!

You are so sweet..  We just got back from going over there and a neighbor said everyone was 'out of town' save one construction guy.  He (very nice of him) took our numbers and said he'd ask to have it unlocked, and call once it was.  BEEEEEauty!    So, hopefully it'll happen.   Keep me posted on the cat fight!  Yikes

Right on sweetie.  You are a brilliant brain.  I'm sure Lorick can help you guys with whatever I can't on the programming end, so know that you WILL succeed!!  I loves ya!!!  I can't wait to see ya either.  Which movies??  Evil dead sweetie??  Joy will definitely hang out i we get that one..

It's Jason's birthday today, so we're taking him out for lunch (with a bad check!!).  It's a good day so far.  I'll talk to Joy tonight about the computer stuff, but she should grab a catalog from work if she can, just so I can show her how things are packaged together, etc.  Loves!!

Hey bbbbbbbb baby.  Dig this: Sunday, at St. James Cathedral, this choir that Erica (my co-worker) belongs to is singing Lux Aeterna by Ligeti, the choral thing from 2001!!!!  This is sung, like, maybe once every 6 or 7 years around here, so we should definitely check it out.  And in St James..  have you been there??  It's a beautiful building.  
How's the day goin??  I'm so excited to get off!!!  I miss ya.  Pre- movie lovin?  Ok, we'll see..  

The librarian from Seattle Symphony called and needs people to extract parts from a Solero score she made, payin $12 an hour!!  So, I'm gonna come in for a coupla hours Sunday, and an hour or two every night this week.  Nice easy money and looks good on the resume.  Loves..

Hey Gorgeo little Plum flower,

	Nope, I won't let 'em.  This is bad, but I actually hope it gets ugly so I can just storm out with a barabaric 'fuck you all' beating my chest and screaming at a gorilla pitch.  I know I know, but it would be so much easier, and we could yoga right away!!  

	Two things I forgot to tell ya,
	Jill called last night, and now she's moving into her dream house with Pete and the kids!?!  I told her careful and she said I know with a bit of defensiveness.  She loves you to DEATH and wants us both to come pack/drink with her friday, so I said we'd show, cooL?

	And........  I may go get the model-photographer-from-blowup-haircut today if I get time.  Speak now or forever hold...

I love ya bebe..

I know I know...  The serbs were just receiving all this sympathy a few years ago, don't forget, and were the victims of the same thing.  I think it's a pretty damn barbaric over there, but not surprising.  When it gets hot, people go stir crazy, if ya know what I mean.  Loves

Hey sweetie busy day.  The serbs were victimized in the midst of the fracturing of Russia, by the 'Bosnians'.  It was a similar situation, we were told, to the whites and the American Indians, since the Serbs were natives of the region.  I think, though, this was in Bosnia-Herzegovina (sp?) or whatever and not in Yugoslavia proper.  I'm kinda confused.  There's a Yugoslavia still, which b-h is not a part of, but is it where Kosova is?  Ilir (the guy with all the email) is talking about Yugoslavia and Kosova frequently, but it's confusing where these are in relation to my now-outdated geography.

Sweetie-baby what's up?  Good day?  I hope so.  I'll see ya 'bout 6:30.  Write back!

Sincerely,
Your beeeeeotch,
Ben

Oh sweetie baby I'm so glad I make ya happy.   So here's  what's up: we've been in a meeting for about an hour, talking about various issues.  The last topic was that they wanted a 'slot' person to go to Russia to train them there, for about a month.  To make a long story short, it looks like the slot people can't go.  Whaddya think??  Scary huh??  Just an idea.  I think it'd have good and bad points outside of work, but might be an experience I can't afford to miss!  This is sheer speculation, 'cause it's all based on Mike (guy we went to Nitelite with) saying "man YOU should go, none of us can go.."  !!!  Anyway, I'd be able to get ya some neat stuff!!! :()

Did the saandwich treatcha right??  Good darlin.  You are my cozy darlin and I love ya.  See ya soon.  Write back.

That sucks you missed the bus.  Ruth's # is 3291676.  My day's ok but I'm feelin a little tired.  I feel a little attention starved lately, I don't know why.  I really love ya and finally had a sec to contemplate that the other night while I was lifting weights to Carole King.. God you go with a dork eh?  So I feel mellow but ok.  

I'm psyched for school today 'cause these guys from CNMAT (Center for New Music and Technology, I think) at Berkeley are coming to demo they're latest research.  Could you come check it out??  If I don't hear back, it's at 2:30 in rm 9 of the art bldg.  This may be what I wanna do for my master's, I'm not sure.  They get a LOT of $$ from the music industry for research... 

love ya darlin

Hey sweetie.  Goin to see Lisa sounds good.  I'll need to prep this weekend and next week, though.  I have to get the Tarkovsky paper started (meaning I have to watch Ivan and Sacrifice, and Solaris again) and get to the next phase of my computer piece (about 8 hrs of lab time).  So, if this is definite, I'll get things down to the space tomorrow, and work here a bit sunday.  That way, I can take a Tues or Thurs off next week and be all caught up for the weekend.  Sound good?

I didn't get a chance to tell you about the presentation last night.  Remind me later.  It was cool but not as outlandish as I anticipated...

Loves ya lots.  I'll let ya know when I get ahold of Jace..

Well I was just saying that we should look at the schedule, figure out what we want to see, and make sure there aren't too many collisions with the secret festival showings at the Egyptian because, you see, it might somewhat 'silly' to get the secret festival pass if we can't go to many of the shows, right?  :)

Kelly's the girl he has been on-again-off-again for years.  The same one.  His first real girlfriend.  You may remember me consoling her alot right after we start goin out.. I met her a few time at the Big Time for beers. ??  Anyway she's real cool and has her shit together and I think they've been engaged like three times now.. 
He's working some computer thing and doesn't have a visa, so he's travelling a lot in the near future.  Vietnam he says.  !! 

Wow what a busy day here today.  I just talked to Laura, who says she can get me housesitting gigs at $20 a day easy.  Extra money for NM??  I told her to gimme gimme!  She's great I miss her ALOT from that job.. :(  

loves baby!!

It's not www.siff.com, that's the shanghai film fest! Lemme know sweetie.

I missed you too sweetus, the Art Bell show was kind of a false alarm... He talked about a bunch of volcanic activity that will swallow up 1/3 of the US, beginning next month.. It wasn't any more believable than much of the other stuff he has on the show, but who knows...  prepare the shelter...  The Hopi's are on next week, so I was kinda disappointed...

Bummer bummer.  I have to finish this lame ass Christian tune... boo.  I love ya so and wanted to talk to you tooo!!!  I just had kept everyone waiting on me 'cause I called my Grandma Boo and Uncle Jeff and it took forever, of course.  My Grandma hasta have an MRI because they think she MIGHT have had two strokes (mild ones), so we'll wait and see if she makes it up for the fourth of July like my mama wants... She's gonna be real upset when she hears about the MRI thing, if she hasn't heard already (I kinda thought from how my Uncle was talking that she hadn't).  So what's goin on tonight?  I wanna get some music down, just mess on the 4 track, but wanna see you too.  Maybe we can hang out tonight and I can do the 4 track tomorrow?  See, I gotta see ya sweetie.  Yep, maybe a stoney movie and the last of the yums, or go for a cheap beer with dave or play a game or somethin..  Lemme know..  I love ya!

the meeting went ok.  I think a lot of people are willing to say similar things at their respective interviews, but we're not uniting against Sunhawk or anything like that... It's got me a little more hopeful, anyway..  How's it goin there?

Hey sweetie baby I JUST got here like a half hour ago!!!  I set the alarm for 5:45pm accidentally.  The cool thing is it only took 1/2hr on 99 this morning; I hope it stays that way.  Yep I had a good time and Christopher Walken is WAY creepy (he plays the devil) in this movie.  It didn't keep me hyped enough, though, and I fell asleep.  :*(  So.  I love you too, and yes, I do think I could do it.  I read about the cyclists and the cops only arrested two out of like 15, because they were riding quickly in and out of the crowd.  The cops made it clear that they could've arrested the rest of the guys with them (like 6 others) who weren't riding as dangerously, but didn't. ? Whadya think?  I think the cops could do nothing but be nice in this situation.. The article said nothing about the council actually HAVING them arrested, but they did say they were cool with it.  And yep, it was two guys. Probly more than you wated to hear, but oh well.  So I'll be off a 7.. Lemme know if that's too late and you need your keys sooner.  Loves!

Wilde is at 7 and 9:30 at the Egyptian.  Would you rather go see that than Bulworth?  I thought that was s'posed to be good, at least the times thinks so.  Of course my only concern is that after 2 hours on capitol hill you'll JUST wanna go home and sleep.. ;*<

Sweetie sweetie I love ya and want ya too, I guess sometimes I feel like you need to talk it out rather than just do it, ya know?  I don't know, maybe it sounds cold or something to you but it sounds good and warm to me; I just get the feeling (correctly) that you're unhappy lately with things (except us) and you need to shift focus to those things more I think.  So maybe I was pickin your brain about it too much last night, I'm sorry.  I just want ya to figure things out and be content and secure with yourself.  I love ya.

I haven't gotten to the outtakes yet, but I'll let ya know.. The mono stuff is MASS MORE punk than the stereo.. Helter Skelter sounds like they did on my 4track..

See what happens when you just let it flow?   You have suspended MY disbelief, anyway..  Keep goin and you'll be surprised at how far you can go.

loves baby loves keep your head up ok?  You are REALREAL talented so don't be scared..

Yeah sure I remember it..  I guess I'd want it, but it depends on how much you guys want to sell it to me for.  It would eat into the New Mex $$ if Dave wanted his half right away...  How much do you think you'll want if it's in good shape?

Lees I don't know what to tell you about Joy.. It's been the same since you moved in darlin.  I think in the past I've been a harsho about the Joyless. Ummm..  I don't think you should continue to jab her though, unless you really wanna talk it out, because it seems she thinks she's right about how she appears to people, or at least cares about it only to that point...  I think you should get a place with Ruth.  Is this email from yesterday still getting passed back and forth today?  Whata bitch man.  She makes me mad. >:(#( (mad baring teeth)...  Ok that's all the negative vibes I'll give it...

Yeah lees wait for me that would be better.  I'm really tired too.. I'm gonna have to caffeine it up this afternoon.. :(   I mixed everything up but didn't taste it yet!  Hope it's good.  The chicken wasn't done 'til about 1:30 or so in the morning.   Matt and I played a little bit and it was fun.  It's good to just free-associate out loud, there's something cleansing about it.  One highlight, I think the only line I remember, was "The soft warm redness of the womb I see in your eyes."  Too weird, or good n mushy?  Love ya sweetie.

Hey darlin,

	Yep you bethca you can have a free guitar lesson!! Practice these chords, then I can give a ya a couple of things to do with the chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim.  OK?  I love you too and I am yours so don't worry. The ride was hell, I'm drinking coffee now, but it hasn't kicked in yet.  It was VERY difficult getting up this morning.  I saw the beginning of an old star trek last night (every night at 11:30 lees!), that I'd never seen.. It was called The Changeling and was about a probe shot from earth "way back in the 20th century" that thought kirk was "the creator".. Kinda like the first movie, eh.. I can't wait to see ya!

We can do a serious, huge job search, talk to employment counselors, etc. if you want, or we can give school another stab, if you want.  I'm here to help ya!

Yep, and I get my shoes off right away so I'm cooler.. :) I'm listening to this cd called "hyper-beatles" that a guy at work brought in... It's all these modern music people (John Cage etc) arranging Beatles tunes..  REALLY weird but pretty cool..  I printed out the Hoagland papers for later perusal.  Did you look at the crocodile yet on art's website?  G-ross!

Sweetie baby,

	It's a fun morning so far, 'cause our old intern Jessica is back.  She is like Heather's little sister practically, and part of our gang kinda, so everyone's happy this morning.. Also, CEO of Sunhawk Marlin (my boss) is on KUOW this morning, so that's blasting in the office.  Loves as usual and I had fun too!  Last night was a blast.  More nights like that, please.

Tonight?  Sure..  I wanted to go to my house and do some music..  I thought we could go out and then have a night where we hang out and do our stuff together.  Y;'know, "I jes like being in the same space as you" kinda thing..  If no, it's cool. I can understand you wanting to get your room together.  I can help you clean up real quick if that's all, but maybe you have to do garden stuff too.  ??  I could cook ya something up at my house, or we could go out...

Well tonight should be totally cool.  You didn't say anything on the phone about the offramp, is that what you're doin tonight?  I could meet you there, or at your house (which would be better) or whatever..  Tell me what's up.  It's real flattering that I was missed, but I don't remember who brandi is! I'm surprised that Mickey said anything!  :) I guess I just felt outa place down in Ariz so I probly misinterpreted everything! But I'm better now.  I love you long time.  Big lots. mmmmm Hi. So I need to get out of the depressing zone, it'll be fun to go out with ya.  The headache is leavin! I got $40 for goin out money, k? Loves baby. Oh yeah which one's John.

You are my sweetie sweetus and I love ya so.  
At times, the birds sing, the flowers grow, the kitties get up real real slow, the coffee tastes good, and the kitchen's clean, but none of this compares to you, my queen.   When angels shout the truths of time, and I can't think of anything else to rhyme, I try not to touch my little ******, and think of you impersonating little greenie.  The myth of time is really tame, the revelations of love ding-dang mundane, the ancient's can't comprehend the scene, of a video and glass of wine with you, my queen.

No no you won't get bad credit.  It'll be one thing on your record, and that doesn't give you 'bad credit'.  It sucks, because you have to take tons of time and go to court in order to fight this--the cops don't take care of this stuff.

Hey,

	Sorry I've been outa touch a bit... I spent the last coupla weeks trying to get into the composition program at the U (I got in!) and been busy with that.  I want to hold the single until November if possible; I'll have two or three more recordings for possible b-sides.  Is that cool?  Is that dumb?  We don't have any momentum we're going to lose, as far as I know, so I thought it'd be no big deal.  I'm putting together a four-guitar/synth band to play these, in case I get some gigs after this.  Take it easy.

Hey man,

	Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  Recording the String Quartet I intended as a B-side was a fruitless endeavor, so we're gonna re-record Go Keanu and b-side that.  Cool?  How bout a beer this Thurs?  You open?  We can talk more then.  Give a call after 6 tonight, if convenient: 364 4651.

Wow Fort Collins?  What up w/that?  I'm waiting to get into this practice space in Fremont.  100$ and BIG.  I'm pretty stoked.  
I've been writing a lot, about 50% is decent so.. we should have a full disk by Juneish.  It's going good.  I've got some weird instrumentation stuff  I'm working on too, which I may or may not put on the record.  
I wanna hear this record.  When can I?

Tell me when you're back and we can hang and listen.  Take care.

Hey

	What happened to your space??  I have someone sharing it already, and don't move in 'til the end of the month.  I'll keep my ear out. What's up?...  Nabil showed me the artwork for the CD, looks tough baby looks tough.  I'm getting the shit written and will have an ADAT at the space to lay it all down.  I haven't emailed 'cause I want to have a demo-type thing done for you to check out, but it's taking longer to get into this space... sucks..  
Anyway what's up next week?  Let's have a beer and I'll play ya what I got (if anything), ok?  Take it easy.

Hey Lance.  Man, I'm REALLY sorry to keep trailin ya along like this, it's just that I'm spending alot of extra time getting parts and shit together for a piece of mine that's goin to be performed on Sept 10.  The rehearsals start next week, and I'm touchin up the score and helping the sax player with my part.  To sum it up, I'm juggling this time with work time and keep anticipating an end to it.  At any rate, it'll be over next week when the rehearsals start, so I have no choice but to quit workin on it then...  Am I makin any sense?  
I wanna chill out over there and help ya out but I haven't had more than a free hour in a while... Next week should be open, unless everyone freaks out when they see my parts on Wednesday.  Sorry again but times just too tight because of this performance.  Let's say next tues, and if not I'll let ya know monday, ok?  If that's not good, NEXT sunday is good too.  Write back or gimme a call, and let me know if I can answer any questions over the phone/email.  How's the record doing?  Talk to ya later...

We have a feature in the editor under Guitar>chord figure>etc..  That gives you a default version of that particular chord.  The only other file is something a coworker of mine has been putting together of sub-standard chord voicings, but I believe he no longer has it.  I will take a look and get back to you.  For now, try to edit the chords that come in the program. :) Thanks.

Hi Nicholas,

	Ok, this is a tricky one.  What you do to accomplish two separate systems on the same vertical pos. is mainly a manual task.  Basically, you must create two separate systems.  
	In each measure of each system, place hold measure width formatter hints to keep the small (two measures) staves from becoming as wide as the page.  You may have a case where you have put the hints in, but the staff lines DO appear as wide as the page.  You will also notice that there is no barline at the end of these systems, but there IS one closer to the center of the page on each system.  Jerking this barline back and forth (select, ctrl+rightarrow, ctrl+leftarrow) will cause the staff lines to paint appropriately.  (sorry, bug)  Next, manually place the systems  at the same vertical pos, making adjustments to the staves as need be. Note that you will probably have to manually place the other staves on the page, and probably format the individually.  This is necessary in cases like this.  

To sum up:
1) Place "Hold measure width" formatter hints in the measures of the "short systems"
2) Format Pages
3) Correct lengthy staff lines
4) Manually place systems in appropriate locations

...if this is too confusing, we can do it over the phone tomorrow.  I'm in 8am-4pm Pacific, so let me know if/when to call.  

	When you get this far, you will notice playback problems.  This is because the song rendering part of the program recognizes individual systems based on the system icon's vertical position.  So, if you have two system icons at the same vertical pos, they wont section separately and wont play back at different times.  There IS a way around this, though.  When you are done with the file and ready to work out the playback, do the following:

1)select system icon of the second staff (the coda staff)
2)disconnect from the two staff icons
3)move the now-disconnected sys icon slightly below the previous sys icon (in this case beginning with the words "only see tonight"), and reconnect to the two staff icons.  Now the song renderer will sense two separate staves here!

Hope this helps!  I know these emails contain many steps, please bear with me as I try to train you over the email!  Thanks and don't forget to let me know if I should call.

Hey sweetie,

	I lucked out on this job so baaaaad!! Brent calls this mornign and goes "let's just skip it til friday...I don't want to get your cold!"  Nice!  So I'm home doing my thing all day.  Maybe I'll be able to get a lot of writing done...it helps me a lot to explain my thoughts out loud.  I got a few things straight in my head last night.  
	I went on the art bell page and found www.meru.org  -- it's the website dealing with the hidden stuff in the Hebrew alphabet.  I thought you would dig it if you have time to check it out.  I did a little and it looks cool.
	I hope everythings going good and not too boring.  I love ya.

	Oh my God are you as stoked as I am for this weekend!!!!!   I can't wait!!  I had a good big long talk with Yous about stuff last night.  I think a lot of air got cleared.  :)
	I was thinking we HAVE to go to the laser show this time.  Which restaurant to we go to - the Mexicans or the hicks???  I CAN'T WAIT.  I think it just hit me this morning.  Plus, we can make tape #2 in the back of E's truck for my piece, and swim, and run around, and do it, and and and...

	I am soooo excited.  This Xenakis score that I requested at the beginning of June as an interlibrary loan FINALLY came!!!  I get to finally see this piece.  It's called Pithoprakta and has everyone knocking on their instruments at the beginning; I know I played it for you before. What did you write for the contest today?  :)

Indeed, it was becoming increasingly hard for Miss Polk to differentiate between friend and foe at this point.  She caught herself slipping quietly into her usual role of passive bystander as the two men carried on their seemingly friendly, but underlyingly hostile hostile banter.  To her surprise she found herself reflecting on her 25 years spent pliantly laboring beneath the big M of the nineteenth floor.  The tangled menagerie of the days events was proving to have a profound and unexpected effect on Miss Polk.  Tasso, you old fool, do something - anything. Just as this thought was crossing her mind, she spotted the edge of something sticking out from underneath the Oriental runner in the hall.  It was almost directly below where the two men were still straining to give their conversation some versimilitude.  She walked right past them and into Mr. Merriweather's study, deftly pushing the computer disc beneath the rug with one quick tap from the toe of her extremely sensible shoes.

Hi Sweetie,

	It has been soooo busy todaY!!!!  A bunch of people are taking off for trade shows next week, so it's been kind of insane anticipating that.  I love ya.  Last night was so good even if we barely got to hang out.  After Tomorrow (hopefully) everything will be great.  If I get my piece done tonight, we'll be all clear for saturday, sunday, and beyond.  I hope youre having a good day.  I'll try to call, but it's another day with the owner, so I hope those dreams you had last night are concerning you much.   love ya

Hey sweetie.  I just wanted you to know I love ya and I'm pulling for ya to get into your class tonight.  I guess you're gone all afternoon, so I might not talk to you til tonight.  I had so much fun this weekend/last week with you!  You are the best.
Is your day goin good?  What is this class you've been in?  There's a new receptionist guy to -- where the hell is Kunga!?  Why wasn't I consulted?  Ok I love ya and I'll talk to you later, ok?  Call me at work!  I asked for a raise and got reassigned to all-guitar stuff, and I got $1088 instead of $808 from school, so it's been a good day.  Bye!

Well, I guess you're emailing me from your class, cause I can't get you on the phone!  I'm just editing away, not much else.  It's boring music.. some German "lieder" (song), for just piano and voice.  ;(  You can teach me access now.  Call if you can, otherwise I'll talk to ya when I get home (about 9).  Love!

	Hows the day so far?  Hungover?  I sure was for a little bit.  We have a real busy day today - we have to find all the bugs (as many as we can) in a new version of the music editor program.  Sucks.  Anyway, I'm sitting here listenin to the Meat Puppets thinking about when we were in Arizona.  I'm so glad we went -- good call.  I had so much fun last night. You were cracking we up real bad dookadaka.  I'll call later. Love ya.  O yeah, the clock in your kitchen is slow by like at least ten minutes.  :( A long HARD PAINFUL walk up to 45th this morning!

Hi Sweetie,

	Hows it goin??  more lOVIN!!!!  More more more!!!  Need MORE!!! more more more more more ok.  So I had a good day so far, except my computer's been on acid until about 10 minutes ago.  The coolest old guy came and talk with us at composer lab today.  He's a composer, arranger, conductor, etc, but most of all a COPYIST - someone who copys part and scores by hand.  He was really funny and charismatic, and gives lessons for FREE!, so I'm going to finish this piece and go show him.  I really was engaged by what he had to say, I'll have to tell you about it.  Can you bring some yums by for ol Ben??  Andy and I may see Starship Troopers tonight, and go drink.  So..  I'll talk to ya soon.  Loves

I GOT THE SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm so relieved.  $200/month, and that's split in half with Lorick and whoever.  The other cool thing, is that he's building an apt. above, which either Lorick, me, or us (we'll see about that...) will rent...  I'm pretty elated right now.  Here's the GBV concert page:

http://www.liveconcerts.com/listening/kcrw/
 at the bottom is a box that says "select a performance".  When you click on it you get a BIG list.  The gbv is there, as well as a bunch of other stuff.

Hi sweet,

	I went out at lunch and didn't find any airwalks :( but I got two really good cds.  I got the Elliot Smith one which is awesome and also Supergrass, who were also on that soundtrack.  Have I been brainwashed or what??  You will REALLY dig supergrass ALOT, like the best brit band in ages. WAY better than oasis man way better.  "late at night we go out smoke a fag put it out see our friend scream and shout, feel alright"  you get the idea.  Anyway I'll call when I get home.  Love ya baby!

Alright sweetie you need to write first on at least one morning right?  Ok.  I had a blast last night and am real tired but REAL excited to see you tonight.  I was real good and got in here at 8:00, so I get extra points.
 
	What're we doing tonight?  Tomorrow night is Micro mini's CD release, which we have to go to, so keep that in mind, if you can go.  Did you finish the books I gotcha?  Don't forget to lend me the joke or whichever one tonight, ok?  Loves.

Hey darlin,

	No raise yet!! :)  God what a horrible dream.  Check out what my Yugoslav friend sent me:

Hello Ben.

You are already helping by forwarding the messages, thanks.

How are your studies going on ? and your piece you told me about ?

I have a very interesting proposition for you. 
I received an invitation from a group of albanian musicians
that are studying in different universities of Europe. I know
a few of them and they are quite good.
They whant to make an ensemble or a small orchestra
and work on some experimental & electroacoustic & new stuff. 
Those musicians are of all kinds and genres of music, 
classical, jazz, ethno & stuff.

What they whant from me is to writte music for them and
help them in preparing their performances.

If you`re interested on this I can send you complete configuration
of the instrumentarium & stuff. I believe, they will greatfully exept 
your composition. What do you think ?

I was very off my music these last few months. I can hardly focus
on anything else exept what is happening to my people. I did
some video clips regarding children victims on recent police
attacks on albanian civilians. Those are now shown constantly
on albanian satelite TV programme. I belive they will be on the
net soon.

Other than this, everything sucks. The situation is worse by every
hour. It is unberable. I hope things will cool down a bit and I would
be able to travel to states, finaly.

Your friend.

ilir..


Neat, huh?  I feel so helpless to help, but I guess it's enough to forward these.  I was just forwarding to a few people occasionally, but I stepped it up a bit, as you probably just read.  Anyone else to add?  Gimme Coleman and Joy email, if ya would.  I loves ya sweet.  Hope your day's goin good.  xxxooxx

Well, my Russia chances just went up about 25%, because I found out another one of the slot people isn't going (the other one with a kid).  Wish me luck!!  I'm listening to a tape I made last night of all the ktel hits and 45s we've gotten lately.  "ooooooooooooooooooooo what a lonely booooooooooooooy.."  .....

Ok it's final. NONE of the slot people are goin so I should be next in line.  I just asked the third guy and he doesn't wanna go.  It's in "Chelyabinsk", on the southeastern part of the Ural (sp?) mountains.  Oh man oh man.  Ok I'm all excited now, I'll write or call if I find anything out.  :):)  Loves baby I missed last night big time.

Sweetie sweetie!  What's goin on?  Are you $200 richer from the pub quiz?  I hope so.  We need to GO OUT!!
I had a real fun time last night, stayed up with sean until 1:30 drinkin and smokin (woooooo does my head hurt!).  We recorded a bunch but the song they were workin on was pretty uninspiring for everyone.  Jason fell asleep at 10:30!  Fun though..
Did you see the sky last night as the sun set?  Spooky..  
Do you wanna go to Discovery and then watch Sacrifice?  I need to watch these this week BAD!!!  I love ya write me back!

Oh man I am so tired this morning.  Luckily, there are only three people here, or I'd be worried!  I get so much email everyday now from that Tarkovsky list.  Sure'd like to see you flaunt your smarts there.. 

What's goin on?  What' d y'have to use your car for at lunch?  Really sweetie you don't need to get me presents, but you can.  I guess it's OK.  I mean, I do like presents and all, so you can get me presents.  Just don't spend too much on the presents. Sweetie it was just my birthday really...  

This Cibo Matto is so good too bad you only think to listen to it when I take it a month after I gave it to ya!!!!  Ask one of the 90120 people if they've heard of Days of the new, cause I wanna know what they sound like..  Did you read that thing from Ilir?  :(:(  Scary.  I hope he's ok.

Did you forward the Kosove emails to someone named Lululand@u.was...?  Someone emailed me with this name saying we should email the president. Doubt it would do any good, but maybe I should..

>> We took President Clinton's word that bombing Sudan and Afghanistan
>> was
>> necessary and that our forces punished the right people. We should
>> have
>> known better. His original story, as usual, isn't holding up to
>> scrutiny. 
>> 
>> On Aug. 20, three days after half-confessing to lying about Monica
>> Lewinsky, Clinton ordered our military to pump as many as 20 Tomahawk
>> missiles into a plant in Sudan, a Muslim nation with which we have
>> heretofore had no major quarrel. 
>> 
>> Clinton ordered another 60 or so Tomahawks launched against six camps
>> near Khost, Afghanistan. 
>> 
>> To justify its attacks, the White House invoked the specters of nerve
>> gas and a gathering of international terrorists. 
>> 
>> Yet over the past 11 days, press reports have put the lie to several
>> statements made by Clinton and his officers to justify the two
>> attacks.
>> As these statements have become inoperative, officials have spun new
>> justifications - further raising suspicions the attacks were ordered
>> to
>> shift attention from Clinton's personal woes. 
>> 
>> SUDAN 
>> 
>> Heavily guarded. That's how the administration described the so-called
>> ''chemical weapons-related'' plant hours after U.S. missiles destroyed
>> it. 
>> 
>> But British engineer Tom Carnaffin, who worked at the plant from '92
>> to
>> '96, told The New York Times: ''It was never a plant of high security.
>> You could walk around anywhere you liked, and no one tried to stop
>> you.'' 
>> 
>> Military Industrial Complex. The day after the attack, Clinton
>> officials
>> said the plant was owned by Sudan as part of its so-called Military
>> Industrial Complex. But the press found the outright owner to be a
>> Saudi
>> Arabian banker with offices in London. 
>> 
>> No commercial products. Early on, the administration also claimed the
>> plant wasn't making medicine. 
>> 
>> ''We have no evidence or have seen no products, commercial products,
>> that are sold out of this facility,'' a senior official told
>> reporters. 
>> 
>> Not so. It was clear the plant supplied malaria tablets for kids and
>> drugs for livestock. In fact, it produced as much as half of Sudan's
>> drugs and even had a contract with the United Nations. 
>> 
>> Reporters who toured the area afterward spotted drug-related products
>> in
>> the debris. TV footage showed piles of pill bottles. 
>> 
>> Administration officials now concede the plant had commercial uses.
>> But
>> the new spin is that it was a ''dual use facility,'' making both
>> medicine and ingredients for chemical weapons. 
>> 
>> Physical evidence. For several days after the strike, the
>> administration
>> refused to talk about its evidence in detail. It just said it was
>> ''compelling,'' ''irrefutable'' and ''convincing.'' 
>> 
>> But the press demanded details. 
>> 
>> So three days after the strike, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
>> went on CNN to insist the plant was making a ''precursor'' to the
>> deadly
>> VX nerve gas. 
>> 
>> ''We have physical evidence,'' he added. 
>> 
>> Will you release it to the public? asked CNN reporter Wolf Blitzer.
>> No,
>> Berger replied. It's ''confidential'' information. 
>> 
>> The next day ''two administration officials'' told The New York Times
>> that the U.S. had secretly obtained a soil sample from the site before
>> the attack. It contained a chemical used in VX, the anonymous sources
>> said. 
>> 
>> But they would not name the agent. 
>> 
>> Under more pressure to reveal details, officials the next day said the
>> agent was an acid called EMPTA. They claimed it had no use except to
>> make chemical weapons. 
>> 
>> But the claim has two major problems. 
>> 
>> For one, EMPTA doesn't show up on the list of chemicals covered under
>> the international treaty barring chemical weapons. 
>> 
>> And the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says
>> EMPTA
>> can be used ''for legitimate commercial purposes,'' such as making
>> fungicides. 
>> 
>> Also, The New York Times reported that EMPTA's chemical structure is
>> ''very similar'' to insecticides and herbicides sold commercially,
>> like
>> the weed killer Round-Up. Because the government took just one soil
>> sample, it might have misidentified what it found. 
>> 
>> (Even if the sample was EMPTA, that doesn't prove the plant was making
>> it. The acid could have been stored there or spilled in transit.) 
>> 
>> A plant making chemical weapons needs special glass-lined reactors and
>> tubes that can withstand corrosion by highly toxic chemicals. It would
>> also need lots of space for such equipment, as well as for stockpiling
>> chemicals. 
>> 
>> The plant had neither, according to former workers and reporters who
>> have seen the wreckage. 
>> 
>> To limit casualties among workers, the White House says it took pains
>> to
>> bomb the plant after it was closed. Local reports said 10 people were
>> hurt, four of them critically. And one person was killed. 
>> 
>> But the Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. plant was in the midst
>> of
>> the city of Khartoum. If the administration was so sure the plant made
>> deadly chemicals, why would it risk sending vapors into the air and
>> killing hundreds or thousands of Sudanese? 
>> 
>> Another curious note: TV footage after the blast showed Sudanese
>> firefighters dousing flames inside the plant with no protective gear.
>> If
>> deadly chemicals were present, surely they would have been overcome by
>> the vapors. 
>> 
>> Just a drop of VX, if inhaled, can kill an adult in minutes. 
>> 
>> Bin Laden link. Most critical to Clinton's case for knocking out the
>> plant was the Osama bin Laden tie-in. It doesn't exist. 
>> 
>> On the day of the attack, Defense Secretary William Cohen said that
>> bin
>> Laden, a millionaire, ''had some financial interest in this
>> facility.'' 
>> 
>> Berger echoed him: ''We know that bin Laden has been a substantial
>> contributor.'' 
>> 
>> The press found no such funding link. The plant owner never did
>> business
>> with bin Laden. What's more, bin Laden hasn't lived in Sudan since
>> '95. 
>> 
>> Administration officials, speaking anonymously, now admit the link is
>> not so clear after all. One called it ''fuzzy.'' 
>> 
>> As doubts grew last week about the bin Laden link, a new story emerged
>> to justify the strike: Iraq had a role in the plant. Once again,
>> officials leaking that new line would not go on record. 
>> 
>> Even if it's true, it doesn't make the case. Clinton said the strike
>> was
>> in response to the embassy bombings in Africa. Bin Laden was behind
>> the
>> bombings and was funding the chemical- weapons plant in Sudan. The
>> idea
>> was to punish bin Laden, not Iraq. 
>> 
>> AFGHANISTAN 
>> 
>> Infrastructure damage. The day after the administration rained down
>> missiles on Afghanistan, officials claimed they destroyed or damaged
>> many buildings in what they described as bin Laden's base. 
>> 
>> That's a stretch. 
>> 
>> It turns out bin Laden's headquarters was nothing more than mud huts
>> and
>> tents sprawled out in the mountains where mujahedeen once hid from
>> Soviets. 
>> 
>> Officials said we knocked out bin Laden's communications
>> infrastructure.
>> But press reports said bin Laden uses portable satellite telephones,
>> not
>> a centralized command-and-control system that can be hit with a
>> missile.
>> 
>> 
>> A full 48 hours after the strike, the White House said it still
>> couldn't
>> provide satellite photos of the damage. Why? Clouds obscured the site
>> from outer space. On the third day, spokesman Mike McCurry said photos
>> showed the missiles hit their targets, but cloudy weather still
>> prevented a full damage review. 
>> 
>> Unsatisfied by the sketchy details, Associated Press and Reuters
>> reporters trekked to the site near Khost. They reported seeing a bunch
>> of craters but not much wreckage from blown-up ''infrastructure.'' 
>> 
>> Terrorist confab. ''A gathering of key terrorist leaders'' at the camp
>> ''underscored the urgency of our actions,'' Clinton said, coming just
>> 72
>> hours after his televised mea culpa. 
>> 
>> Some first reports put the number of terrorists as high as 600. Yet
>> our
>> missiles - which the administration said struck at night and hit
>> ''barracks'' - killed an estimated 21. 
>> 
>> Now Cohen says it's not clear that the confab ever took place. In
>> fact,
>> some news accounts say most of the camps may have been empty. 
>> 
>> Hurting bin Laden. Berger said bin Laden's training camps were
>> ''rendered ineffective.'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
>> we
>> had a ''significant impact'' on his ''major terrorist camp.'' 
>> 
>> Aside from their hyperbole about damage, they ignored the fact that
>> others used the camps besides bin Laden. 
>> 
>> Pakistani officials said they used two of the four camps hit by
>> missiles
>> to train Pakistanis and Kashmiris for the war against India in
>> Kashmir.
>> In fact, 15 Pakistanis were among the reported dead. 
>> 
>> Another camp was used by Arabs from several countries. And only one
>> was
>> used by bin Laden. He is still at large. 
>> 
>> MORE QUESTIONS 
>> 
>> Sudan and other countries, including U.S. ally Kuwait, have called for
>> the U.S. to turn over its evidence to justify bombing the Sudanese
>> plant. 
>> 
>> Yet the administration refuses. Nor will it let the U.N. conduct an
>> inquiry. Why not? 
>> 
>> The Clinton administration's reluctance to make detailed intelligence
>> information public in order to justify its military strikes contrasts
>> starkly with previous administrations. 
>> 
>> The Reagan administration went so far as to make public the contents
>> of
>> decoded Libyan diplomatic cables in order to support bombing Tripoli.
>> It
>> showed so many photos to support its invasion of Grenada that
>> cartoonists poked fun. And the Bush administration made clear its case
>> against Panama's drug-running dictator. 
>> 
>> Why is this administration so secretive? 
>> 
>> After the strike, Clinton signed an executive order placing bin Laden
>> on
>> the Treasury Department's list of terrorists. Why only now, when he
>> knew
>> bin Laden announced a holy war against America months ago? 
>> 
>> Well before the embassy bombings, the U.S. indicted bin Laden in New
>> York on charges of soliciting murder. So why did Clinton wait until
>> now
>> to go after his training camps? 
>> 
>> If soil samples turned up proof of a Sudanese chemical-weapons program
>> months ago, why didn't we bomb months ago? 
>> 
>> And why have U.N. inspectors been spending all their time trying to
>> catch Iraq producing nerve gas when production was supposedly already
>> under way across the Red Sea in Sudan? 
>> 
>> Clinton said he was acting on ''convincing evidence'' bin Laden was
>> behind the embassy bombings. Yet bin Laden has not been charged. Why
>> not? 
>> 
>> Two terrorists ''linked'' to bin Laden have been charged. But the link
>> is weak. One says he was trained in explosives at an Afghanistan camp
>> ''affiliated'' with bin Laden, court papers say. He says he
>> ''attended''
>> a news conference with bin Laden. 
>> 
>> That's the administration's convincing evidence? 
>> 
>> Clinton said, ''We knew before our attack that these (bin Laden)
>> groups
>> already had planned further actions against us and others.'' 
>> 
>> He also said he knew they plotted to kill the president of Egypt, the
>> pope and, as it turns out, himself. What's more, they planned to bomb
>> six U.S. 747s over the Pacific. 
>> 
>> Pretty specific intelligence. We knew all this, yet we knew absolutely
>> nothing of plans to blow up our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? 
>> 
>> If this retaliatory action was unjustified, Clinton can't blame it on
>> his intelligence officers or the Pentagon. 
>> 
>> ''I decided America must act,'' he boasted in his Aug. 20 Oval Office
>> speech. ''I ordered our armed forces to take action.'' 
>> 
>> In fact, reports say Clinton personally chose the attack site in
>> Sudan. 
>> 
>> And he kept the decision secret, letting only a few advisers in on it.
>> No allies were consulted. Even people in Cohen's office weren't
>> informed. 
>>

Hi all,

	No mushrooms this time, I promise.  :)  

	I'm wondering about the criteria for sensing spikes in the timewave.  A little while ago, we had a bit of debate about 'what was more more novel: Diana or Montserrat?'- or something to that effect.  Are the peaks in novelty to be felt all around, equally in every discipline?
	T, didn't you say on Art Bell that the curve (paraphrasing) wasn't a quantitative tool, but an expression of the average amount of novelty/habit, in the world?
	This would lead me to conclude that the media is an unreliable source for the 'pulse of the world' as it were, since it's really only the pulse of North America (OK US And Canada), Europe, and parts of Asia and the middle east.  Also, which is more novel: The El Nino this year has potentially devasting power; is the devastation more novel than the emergence/realization of the El Nino itself?  If, on a given day, 600,000 people world wide (not that many, right?) take up music and drastically reduce the stress in their lives, is that more novel than, say, the death of a political/social figure?  
	I know it's subjective.  My point is this: I have a feeling that the effects of the timewave are to be felt in personal ways at times, and public ways at times, (sometimes both) but little of the personal effects are clear to me yet.  Maybe they've been expressed in some flavorful language that I don't understand, so feel free to refer me to previous posts.  Thanks.

It has been confirmed. 1 man has been killed yesterday
when the police fired without warning directly to peacefull
albanian protestors in Pej town western of Prishtina
capitol of Kosov, 15 others are wounded, 5 of them are
in critical condition. No statement by the serbian officials
about these killings. More than 150 people has been beaten
by the police.

Today the burial of the victim is going to take place at 14.00h
Already (time is 13.30h) more than 50.000 people are geathered
to show the last respect to the victim. Police has surrounded all
roads to the center and blocked the route which leads to towns
graves.

Just got back from the streets and I saw police everywhere in
every corner. There are a lot of policmans not wearing uniforms.
And a number of serb nationalists parade through the center
with their cars holding serb national flags and shouting threats.
"Death to all albanians", "Long live greater srebia" ,"We will
cut the throats of your children" and simmilar. Many of them
are armed and they point their guns to people on the sidewalks.
Police is chearing them to continue, I whitnessed this myself.

My comment : The only nation that celebrates the killing of
unarmed and innocent civilians and peacefull protestors are
serbs, I`m shocked that not a single serb raised his voice
against the killings and not a single serb expressed his
sympathies to victims famillies.

It is escallating, if international community hasitates to act
we are going to see a new bosnia style war, and there are
indications that it can be much worse than that.

Balkans mad man must be stoped. Raise your voice.

Just got back from the funeral ceremony.
The ceremony was glorious, more than
50.000 albanians were there.

While the police tried to block all roads to
towns centre and graveyard, people allready
made their own route using side roads.
In many points there were strong police forces,
pointing their guns at us, threating us,...

"His fate will be yours too..." shouted a  policeman
refering to victim which was to be buried.

Many people were herrased and beaten while
returning from the ceremony. I merely escaped.

Whatch the news tonight. A lot of foreign
reporters were there, among others N.Roberts
of CNN, and reporters from WTN, ITN, BBS
and others.

This was reported few minutes ago :
serbian forces attacked, using heavy artillery, village Llausha in  Drenica
region. It is the 18th day that they are under siege. Few daring who where
lucky to go in and out of there tell that people there are starving and in
great need for medicines.
Despite of international contact group, US and NATO warnings that they
will not tolerate police violence and repression in Kosove,
Slobodan Milosevic continues his massacre in Kosov,...

Practically, the police hour is on, even it is not officialy pronounced.
In towns at evening hours streets are completely empty, no one dares
to go out. Police and serb nationalists, both armed fully, beat anyone
that they get their hands on to. Serb civilians are armed with AK-70
automatic guns. Last nights many albanian famillies were attacked
on their houses, drunked serbs broke their windows and doors and
shouted to them to go out and "...kill all that were born by an albanian
mother". This was reported also on todays newspapers.

6 americans were arrested yesterday and sentenced to 10 days in
prisson. American congressmans are in Skopje (macedonia), because
Yugoslavia is denying them visas and this for the only reason that they
whant to visit Kosov.

Today there were general elections in Kosove, reports say that about 80%
of the albanians whent to vote. There were parties and individuals that
didn`t took place because of, as they say, wrong timing for the elections.
Police tried to stop voters and albanian officials, confiscating voting
material and threatning to people.
A lot of journalists were there and police was very carefull to not be seen.

Two days ago a Belgium journalist was beaten in Prishtine by the police
and his camera was smashed.

villages are attacked by heavy artillery and army helicopters.
The Drenica scenario is repeating again but this time
in another region, villages near town of Decan and Peje
are attacked, this is the west region of Kosove.

Whitness say that they saw houses in flames, civilian
houses. No reports yet of possible killed and wounded.

In town of Pej, many serb civilians, fully armed, have
been seen leaving the town and heading to the attacked
region. We fear a new massacre on albanians civilians
is taking place....

Serbian police stated tonight that 4 albanians ("terorrists" as they
say) and 1 policeman were killed today.

The numbers may be much higher. No one knows exactly what
is hapening in Decani region. Some reports say that one village
is leveled to the ground by artillery and many villagers have run
to nearby villages.

During these last few hours new reports say that police and army
forces shelled again villages Llausha and Serbica in Drenica
region. Also some fighting took place in other places.

Vojislav Sheshelj - Famous bosnia war criminal, pronounced by
international  tribunal in the Hague as main suspect for war crimes
and ethnic cleansing in bosnia has been elected as president of
serb parliament - today.
We will see the serb nationalism rising, this man will not step down
very easily. He declared many times that US and NATO are their
worst enemies. If this isn`t stoped immidiately - the balkans will explode.
His statement regarding Kosove - "Kill half of them, send half of them
to albania".
________________

Yesterday and today serbian students and profesors protested
in center of prishtine against the agreement between serbian
and albanian  official regarding albanian return to school and
university buildings. Obviously they have a lot of against
albanian education and culture. These are serbs. These
protests very full of nationalist transparents and threats.

________________

I`m so frustrated, surprised and depressed by the ignorance
of the international community and the decisions of the
Contact group about Kosova.

Serbian nationalism is rising and the violence is continuing
and spreading in other regions of Kosova also. The bosnia
war criminals are now in power in serbian parliament and
certainly no good will come out of that.

My nation is still determined to continue with peacefull
resistance, but, we are poor, tired, frustrated from the
continuous violence of these last 9 years (or last 18 years).
There is so much work a head of us restoring our
criplled education system wich was tried violently to
be destroyed by the serbs. Our economy is completely
destroyed and thousands are out of jobs, thanks to
serbs who put them all from the jobs, also. They survive
mainly from the help of the albanians that live and work
in other countries of the world.

My nation proved once more that it is against the war,
that it is, when the religion is in question, one of the
most tolerant nation in the world, despite the serb
propaganda who tries to give the fundamentalism
image to albanians, in fact, if there is a fundamentalism,
than defenitely serb orthodox is the one.

How many times my nation has to prove that again !?!

There is no sign that S.Milosevic is or will redraw his
special police and army forces from Kosove, as he
was asked to do that by the US and Contact group.

Drenica region is completely surrounded still and police
forces are diggin in and constantly new forces arrive
here. It is believed that one family at the village Prekaz
is burried alive in the basement of their house which was
completely destroyed by the hevy artillery almost a month
ago. Nobody can reach them because police won`t let
anyone go there.

Police arrests, almost everyday, people on the roads around
Drenica region and claims all of them to be "terrorists",
Ironicaly as it seems this is the world`s no.1 police force
since it catches everyday "terrorists" and is "very succsesfull"
on eliminating them - untill now they have killed dozens of women
and children and olders - these are "terrorists" that serbian police
and government claims them to be.

There are evidences that policemans very using narcotics in
their last months attacks, many used injections were found and
took to expertise. Experts say that there are clear signs of narcotics
on them. This was practised in bosnia war by serb special forces.

There are also evidences that the munition factory neraby Drenica
region is turned into a concetration camp and that hundreds of
missing albanians are held there, among them many children...

Beating, arresting and kidnaping by the police forces are everyday
events here, as you may read in many foreign newspapers, their
journalists actualy whitnessed many of them.

There are reports (unconfirmed though) that serbia is preparing a
wide spread millitary action against albanians in Kosova,
while they try to make it look like they are for dialogue and peacefull
solution with the albanians...

General protests are scheduled to start in 09.04.1998 in Prishtine.
Since there is no improvement of the very tense and difficult situation...

Milosevic, once more, uses very well the international community`s ,
especially European`s, inability and slowness to take energic actions
against violence and killings of the innocent. So, he will continue and
we are going to whitness more killings, more arrested, more missing
people.

"All we are saying is let`s give peace a chance"

This is the motto of these protests, albanians are
supposed to go out on the streets everyday at 12:00h
to 12:30h local time (GMT+1). No transparents, no
shouting, nothing, just walking an half an hour thru
the centers of the towns of Kosova. 

How more peacefull can it get than this.
But, still, serbian police won`t allow people
to geather, they beat people randomly, children,
women, no exeption...
 

These protests started three days ago in all towns of
Kosova. In Prishtine the first 10 minutes of the protest
the crowd singed the famous refrain wich is the motto
of these protests.
Police didn`t let people geather on the center, so ,the
protestors geathered on nearby streets...

Today, in town of Peja, police attacked the protestors...

As I write this, special police forces patrol thru town
and they pick people randomly, question and beat them.
Some are injured badly. All of them are threatned to not
attend the protests or they "will be eliminated".
  
The protests will continue tomorow at the same time.

_______

The village of Llausha in Drenica region is continuosly shelled
by heavy guns, for days now. Those people there, entire famillies
are in the mercy of serb police and paramillitary forces...

Every day there are new reports of police reinforcements and 
army heavy guns brought to Drenica region and in other regions 
of Kosova.

Serb millitants parade thru the streets of centers of Kosova, armed
and drunked they also beat and threaten albanians...

/In town of Peja, west of Prishtina, capitol of Kosova,/

Again today, but much more brutaly than yesterday, police attacked
a very peacefull protestors. They blocked the center and didn`t let
anyone walk to the center, those caught on the center were beaten
but released soon afterwards.

The total number of policemans was doublle higher than last few days.

Like yesterday, special police force squadrons patroled today also thru
the town, entered albanian pubs, herrasing and beating people randomly,
without any excuse and unprovoced by anyone of them.

15 minutes before the protests, about 10 army tanks, more than 20 trucks,
full of fully armed soldiers, equipment, oil cicterns and other millitary
equipment paraded thru the town and headed in direction of the Drenica
region. Soldiers on tanks and trucks were all the time pointing the guns to
the people on the sidewalks.

However, police didn`t attack the protestors in capitol Prishtina,
prosumably
due to presence of a large number of foreign journalists and diplomats...

Every day new reports of major movements of army forces thru out Kosova.

The situation is very difficult, albanians fear the worst is coming slowly,
serbs
are competely wild and crazy, the international community is silently
watching,
it is completely the same scenario as in Bosnia 5 years ago...

Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic has asked his nation
- serbs - to go out today in a referendum and vote "no" to
international mediation on solving the Kosova problem and
its status. Which means IOW - what ever Milosevic desides
to do with Kosova problem and albanians will be not his
responsibility but his nation`s...

The Serbian government TV propaganda has literarely bombed
his nation with news and comments about " albanian terorrists
and separatists ", and " unprotected serb famillies attacked
everyday by these terrorists ". Their TV is full of interviews of
"suffering serbs in Kosova", a few bad actors have been shown
there as "victims of albanian terorrism".
Second world war, Croatia and Bosnia war documentaries are
constantly on their TV, showing serbs as victims and at the same
time as great patriots and heroes, with their great sense for
"freedom" and "justice".

Even serb independent medias are showing these sights,
although there are few brave journalists and analitics that call
all of this - ridiculous sharade and war spreading propaganda...

___________

The world doesn`t need another reminding of Bosnia tragedy
but if Milosevic isn`t stoped than the world WILL SEE another
and maybe more horrible than Bosnia.

Serbian officials since three days ago are saying that a major
police force action will happen between 24-26 April in Kosova
for "a complete destruction and elimination of terrorist",
as they say, army forces may be called in to participate in the
attack. They "happen to know" that police forces will be provocated
by the "Army for Liberation of Kosova - (ALK)", in 24.April.

    [someone may believe that the worlds no`1 police
    force in catching and killing "terrorists" (read as :
    women and children) know has profilers and visionaires
    in their lines who can predict apsolutely perfectly
    when the "albanian terrorists" will attack and provoce
    their policemans...,amazing,..isn`t it...]

This in other words mean that they have already planed the
attack and that these recent attacks on albanian villages made
by police forces are just overtures to an widely sperad operation
Which IOW (serbian style) means that we are going to whitness
another massacre but this time more bloody that Drenica massacre
itself.

The serb independent medias report that army and police officers
that fought in bosnia are know brought to Kosova to conduct this
operation... We all know what this means, (do you ?)

___________

We, albanians, wait and peacefully protest everyday from 12:00 to 12:30.

We, albanians, are told to wait and be patient, we are doing that these last
9 years...

They kill us, arrest us, beat us, torture us, call us terrorists,....

We protest PEACEFULLY.

What is supposed from us to do next ???

20 albanians killed last two days.

Serbian authorities didn`t wait to hear the results
of their referendum, they knew the results already,
which proves their "regularity" and "democracy".
That same night 8 albanian villages were attacked
with heavy guns. This is happening in the border
zone with albania.

1000 kosova albanians from attacked region escaped
to albania but refused to be registered as refugees.
They stated that they will be back immidiately to
protect their homes and their land from serbian occupation.

Serbian army and Serbian TV last night stated that
20 albanian "terrorists" were eliminated in a fighting
that occured in the border zone between Ygoslavia and
Albania. They showed some pictures from the place and
you could see bodies, but none of them were wearing
uniforms or had weapons. Later they showed a few riffles
and automatic guns and one uniform of Kosova Liberation
Army - KLA.

_________

Two nights ago, after the referendum results, members of
serb radical party the lider of which is Vojislav Seselj, a man
accused for war crimes in bosnia, now a president of serbian
parliament, whent on the streets of the towns in Kosova wearing
black uniforms and waving their black flags. 
These uniforms and flags date back from the second world war, 
chetniks - serbian fashists had those uniforms and flags back
then... Yet, another proof of political orientation of serbs and
their government. A scisofrenic, paranoic fashist regime... 

I believe, the last of that kind in the world...

________

The war is almost certain, as Kosova albanians feel that it has
been enough. Everybody is preparing for the worst, since we
all see the signs of war and we all have expirienced the bosnia
war and we know how the serbs act.

The only hope: - the Contact Group meeting for yugoslavia, which
is going to be held this wednesday. If new sanctions against 
Belgrade regime will not be imposed than Milosevic will have free
hands to do with Kosova what he whants...

23 Albanians killed by the serb army are burried.

There is an eye whitness. According to him this group of albanians 
was traveling by foot to reach to another village that was safer than 
the one they have left runing away from police and army attacks.
Army soldiers first stoped them and then they shouted to them to
run. When albanians started runing soldiers started shooting them.
This man saw everything from a nearby hill. He couldn`t be positive
about were these albanians armed - as army officials claim, but he
claims that this happened 4 km from the border zone and not in
the border zone as army claims and these people were NOT 
entering illegaly from albania, which is another thing that army
claims again.

Another incident today, Army have killed 3 albanians and arrested
4 . Army says that they were attacked by this "group of terrorists".
        
         [ I belive you are amazed by the great number
         of "terrorists" and their ability to move from one
         point of Kosova to the other in a matter of hours,
         not to mention that they are "heavily armed and
         well equiped" - as army and police claims 
         .................R i d i c u l o u s ............]

Tomorow, again, general protests thru out Kosova. The
last effort for a peacefull resolution of the problem.

Technicaly, the war is starting...

Every day villages at Drenica region and Decani region
are bombarded, attacked and shelled constantly. There
isn`t anymore a single day that someone isn`t killed.
Also, people started disappearing in the towns. Some
are reported being kidnaped by people wearing black
uniforms and driving black vans. 

A few days ago army and police gave automatic guns
to local serbs and called them for a mobilisation in,
what they call "defense of their state".

____________


A documentary is recorded by a group of very brave
journalists who were lucky to enter the Drenica region
by night and thru the hills and forests.
Horrible interviews with family members of victims.
A mother explains how did policemans entered her house
and took 4 of her sons and executed them immidiately
right there on her yard.
A man tells how he whent out for days to look for his
children and finds them all killed, the youngest is aged
5 and the oldest 15 years old.
A girl that whitnessed all males of her family, father, uncle
and her brothers executed in front of her...
...
...
______________

The contact group meeting is going to be held this wednesday.
I doubt that europians will make a significant step towards 
end of the violence in Kosova. Milosevic is familliar with empty
threats of new sanctions, in fact, he doesn`t care. The man
is screwing around his own people just to stay in power and
he will continue doing this and kill innocent people until the
US and international community take this guy VERY seriously
and stop him. He is by all means - A Mad Man from Blakans.

Hi Lonnie,

	I'm sorry I had to hustle outa there yesterday, I wanted to talk to you a bit.  I'm a guitarist too, and was curious about your pieces.  Could you send me a few; I'd love to take a look!   (Once they're on the web, they're inaccessible unless you buy a copy.)  I've been playing about twelve years or so, just started teaching, and am trying to find a systematic way of tackling alternate tunings. How 'bout you?
	I have been juggling the idea of publishing a couple of my things, but haven't had time to get them into the computer with all the Sunhawk work to do!!  Look forward to talking to you.

Well, my goals are to develop an approach, a list of steps maybe, to use when approaching an alternate tuning, which would enable the player to understand the possibilities of the tuning and be able to communicate with them to others. I've rarely seen alterenate tunings put to anything more than an 'exploitative' use in a group setting, jazz, rock, or whatever. In the short time I've been teaching, and in the time I've been playing, I've encountered a lot of hesitation to even get involved with alternate tunings.  Solo folk usually delve into them, but when you've only been playing a little while and are playing with others, I guess there are just too many unknowns alot of times.  

All of this aside, are you still teaching?  I haven't had a teacher in ages and am sure there is plenty I have to learn.  Let me know.

Ben

Open up this file.  Double click on the first guitar chord text.  Add 1 space to the text and click OK - you're fucked.  Please fix ASAP.

Hey Lorick,

	Sorry man.  The dotted line in this bug shows up when you hook the object up to some notes.. maybe it's supposed to do this??  Incidentally, we should have this object remain a consistent dotted line if you change the flap length to '0', rather than have there be a long dash at the end of a bunch of short dashes. Sorry if this is kinda nit-picky, but the warner stuff's gotta look good I guess.

Hi Lorick,

	This bug is kinda feature oriented: something we should do before the editor is released.  What happens is this: I make an I-let (or marcato or a variety of other objects), connect it to some notes, and then duplicate it.  When I then connect the duplicate I-let to another note/chord, the note/chord doesn't light up.  I think any file will do it; I'd only send you a new file with two chords to do this with.

Thanks.

>Hi Jill,
>
>I'll fix 3782 and 3783 right away.  I was aware of this problem.  The reason
>this happens is that the formatter no longer divides "leftover" horizontal
>space evenly between measures.  This means that when you are formatting
>"normal" music (not new scores created with the new song wizard), measures
>that have more notes get a larger portion of any "leftover" space than more
>simple measures.  As a result, you see fewer examples where there is a
>system where one measure has a few notes spaced farther apart than necessary
>while at the same time another measure has lots of notes crammed together.
>
>When you create a new score, the first measure has more stuff (clef, key
>sig, etc.) so it gets most of this "leftover" space, leading to the problems
>you mention in the bugs.  I think the best fix is to continue to distribute
>"leftover space" using the new method EXCEPT when there are "only a few"
>measures in the system.  I will define "only a few" as 3 or less.  That will
>fix this bug, but will allow systems with 4 or measures to have a chance at
>formatting in a better way.  Test this out and let me know if it works.

Hey,

	Yeah, good to meet you too.  You gotta move down so we can play out a bit, right?  

	We're supposed to get these bugs done ASAP; Judy wants this stuff up on the website pronto because it's by a new composer.  So, the bug prob is the formatter errors.  I either built these tunes entirely from scratch, using the new song wizard, or had to build them on a recognized page, which only contained about 5 or 6 objects (!) to begin with.  
	See, now that they're done, I can't format anything.  Lemme know what you can do, or who I should ask.

Thanks man,

Ben

Tighten it up to about 1/3rd of that.  Just mention highlights, not a play-by-play.. it's a bit too detailed and they'll cut it down if you don't.

Thanks for getting back to me. The part calls for ride and crash cymbal, three wood blocks (lo, med, high) and triangle. I understand the busy sched. you guys have right now, so I'm hoping to get someone without tons of obligations... maybe I'm in the clouds, who knows?! I will need at least 3 rehearsals, especially with the percussionists.  You are percussionist #6 I've talked to, and I've got about 5 more to hear from.  I'll let you know, probably by  tomorrow night, if no one else can do it.

Thanks again,

I looked today as well as yesterday and there was nothing there. I need to do it earlier in the day, since this is the only time (2:30-5:30) I can meet with my Bass teacher before summer break. If it turns into too much of a hassle, I can call some people to read through it tomorrow, more than likely.  Let me know.  5258612.

Hi,

	I sent you a request for your list, but maybe this is it at http://www.hickory.net/malco/8track/malcotrack.htm  ???  Any of these for sale, or is it stricly trade?  The only thing I have (that I could part with) are some Command Enoch Light records which I have dupes of.  I'm at work, so I have to double check, but if I remember right, I've got Persuasive percussion 1,3 and Provocative perc. 2.  Interested?  I'm real keen on the Beefheart tape and a few others.  Thanks. Saw you in the 8-track movie and loved the bathroom shaving seen (that was you eh?)  OK, take it easy.

Hi Margaret,

	Yep, I'm glad as well!  This is going to be interesting working with you guys over such a long distance.  I'm glad I met you and can "attatch a face" to a name!  :)  Talk to you soon.

Hi Margaret,

	A helpful hint you may not know of: when sizing up braces at the end of a system, link the brace to both staff icons and it will size automatically to the system.  A lot easier than dragging the little green boxes around!

The apostrophe symbol is called a breath mark.  You link it to notes on each staff.  Attached is an example.  
	Say you have a bar with four quarters in each hand, and you want a pause after the third beat.  Since Solero just sticks a pause in and doesn't make up for this act by 'stealing time' from another note (like a grace note), you must  put the pause in the other hand's part as well.  This way, everything will stay rhythmically correct.  Try unlinking the breath mark from the left hand's quarter note and playing, and you'll see what I mean.
	For your info., this mark is taken from vocal music, where it marked places where singers could take a breath.

Hi Margaret,

	Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this.

I'm not sure where on p.21 you are talking about; I don't see any breath marks.  I sour terminology straight?  A system is a group of staves, right? (in this case, 4 staves to the system.)  Just checking.  At any rate, I'll try to answer: When you attach the breath mark to the note previous, it will extend the length of the note.  If you don't do this to other staves, it will set the staves out of phase.  I would like to get on the phone with you and explain a bit of how this works.  When is good for you? Please remind me of the time difference as well. :)


As far as the bed figures go, these are "old school" notation symbols for notes which lasted longer than a whole note, a 'breve' -- very big in choral music.  I think some church missals still employ them, I know the catholic school I went to had such a missal, but they are effectively out of style.  I will ask Gary about it.  Go ahead and send me the file, and don't worry about the breves -- we'll probably do a whole note with a fermata, so put that in for now.  Thanks so much!

Hi Margaret,

	Hope building the workspace for p.20 works out alright.  Let me know.  As far as those "bidir. link" errors go, they owe as much to the bugs in the editor as to bugs in us! ;) Just do your best and let me help if I can; sometimes erasing and replacing works, sometimes you must get into the edit box and find out what you can.  I will try to devise a good test case for this while you're gone, and speak with you on the phone about it.  Hope you had a good vacation!

Hi Margaret,

	Re: house styles: the contrapunctus' (-puncti?) are an exception to what I said in the instruction sheet.  The title and composer aren't already on there, so for now disregard the instruction sheet and keep it for future reference.  I have to format and monkey around with the page before all the header info can fit, so it's not your problem.

>Do you want the Sunhawk copyright put in?  
No, I'll do that.  It messes up the formatting.							
							
>Do I put the title on each page

All I said on the instruction sheet was for you to do the info. on the first page.  The rest of it -- the headers and page numbers -- must be done after formatting the page.
  
>Do I put the composer?
Yes.

By eyeballing it.  This is a feature we've been griping about needing since build 100.

A little trick you should get in the habit of using is the 'next obj' and 'previous obj' (ctrl+shift+n and ctrl+shift+p).  This allows you to select an object, in this case a bar line, and select the next object of that type in the file; it will move to the next/previous bar line if that is the selcted object.  Often, when recognizing or creating systems, Solero creates 'extras', which usually don't appear on the page!  The only way to select these and delete them are via this tool, or when it is selected via the error checker.  (A good rule of thumb for error checking is to hit delete if you can't see the error in question; it is off the page and a mistake!)  
In this file, I selected the first bar line and scrolled through all of them using ctrl+shift+n.  A few times there was nothing highlighted red, so I hit delete, selected the previous bar line, and continued.  You should do this on p.30 to get the feel for this tool, and ask me any questions you may have.  Note that the big green line up the middle of the page doesn't immediately disappear; just go 'view xxx' (a different view than you were using, probably 'zoom to fit'), and go back to the previous viewing mode to get an updated version of what's in the file.

On page 30?  I couldn't find one.  In any case, I would say probably using a line from 'graphic' on the right-click menu.  Are you sure the object in question is a trill or arpeggio and not a mordent?  Check out the objects in 'ornament static' just in case.  The reason I ask is because there is a mordent with a slash, but you probably already knew that.  :)

The impending phone call will have to wait until next week, since I am really busy with students this week.  Let me know when the good times are next week.  And let me just say thanks for all the attention to detail on these scores, it really shows!

I was talking about the mordents with the short vertical lines through them.  If that's not the right thing, use the graphics for the slash and I'll take it from there.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Could you clarify a bit?  Do you mean you lose the file if you shut down while the editor is still running?  You're not supposed to do that (but I'm sure you knew that).

Ok, I guess someone already logged this bug.  I think we're going to try formatting with it at least once.  Try this:  select a system icon for which this problem is occuring, and hit control-f.  Does it fix the slurs alright?  Lemme know.

I HAVE NO IDEA!  Let's consult the Groves....

	"Obsolete musical ornament shown by a sign over the note..."  Hmm..  Attached is a file showing, in actuality, what each mordent does.  By the way, at the beginning of Contr. 8 you were missing some of them, but it cleared up by the end.

Sorry about all this.  Thanks for trying!  I'm forwarding this to Gary so he can see the problems you encountered.

Maybe remind him.  Gary?  Could you send this to her, or pass this on to Tacoma?  Thanks!

These systems are one eight bar system, with two brackets about the two groups.

Leave them separate for now.  I was still waking up and didn't notice the double slash dividing the two systems!  That means they are separate; I assume the joined system thing is a cosmetic feature?  I'll have to ask around.

Send me the files in question, I'll disconnect them, and you can then edit and audio check them.  I'm not sure still why they are connected at all.

Yes, please do.  104 is still OK with me if it's not too frustrating for you.  Do you guys use raid to log the bugs?

Thanks Margaret.  Just to remind you (hopefully I told you in the first place!) I still need you to re-edit the other pages (the ones you sent to Brent) in an earlier build.  I will hopefully hear from Gary today re:how he wants this edited, which will maybe help us out.  Big maybe.  Talk to you soon.

In the edit box for the time sig object, there is a place under parameters to put the numerator (9) and the denominator (16).

If you are talking about the beginning of the second system, it is a type of barline.  Scroll through the barlines using ctrl-up/down, and you will find it.

You aren't doing anything wrong!  The error you're talking about is buggy, so it can't always be considered a legit error.  Leave those troublesome errors for now, and I'll get cracking on them asap.  

I'm really behind on your stuff right now, so maybe I will edit one of the more recent things you've worked on first.

Yes.  What build are you using?  It seems to happen alot in 104x but not so much in 105.  I assume you're in 104c or d, right?

Hi Margaret,

	Can you tell how far behind I am on your stuff?  ;)  I remember p.55 being the first page of Contrapunctus 12, but now I have a three voice, partially repeated piece called 'ich ruf' zu dir, herr Jesu Christ'.  Could you send me a copy of p55, and call it something besides 'bw25_055.rms'?  Anything will do. And could you explain the deal with this new p55 I have?  Thanks!

try this: create a key sig, then ctrl-up/down until the key sig is appropriate.  It doesn't always happen if you select 'F'.

OK, I think you're talking about up and down bow marks. These are under idiomatic markings and, sorry, AREN'T accents.  :(

I WILL need to see the raw on this one.  I think ew can get them smaller, but wait for my reply.  :)

This is mostly in reference to text objects.  'ben marcato' and so forth.  Not really a concern for you as it is with Miriam, Jayne, and Jennifer.

Just double-click on the dynamic to open the edit box, and there will be a box saying 'volume' w/76 in its blank.  Change it to 100 and hit OK.  tada!

Hi Margaret,

	In addition to Mark's advice, you can select a barline, hit play, and the piece will play from that measure to the end of the piece.  I just found out about it, and find it much more useful than selecting the system icon.

	Did the recognizer put the zero in, and what kind of object is it in actuality?

Hi Margaret,

	This mark means n measures of rest, where n is the number of bars of rest.  To get this object, you use the rest bar object, under rest in the right-click menu.

Hi Marlin,

	Here are the guitar pieces I've done so far: Sor Divertissemens op. 1 nos. 1-6.   I reformatted the one pagers to avoid 'seas of white space' (nos. 1 and 4).  Hope they look good.

	I talked to a few guitar folks at the U.  I was surprised to hear that the first thing to come out of the their mouths was "post some Leo Brouwer"..  I didn't think I was that in tune with the classical guitar world.  When I pushed a few people about what they want to see, all I got was one vote for Tarrega. They all groaned at Sor, claiming his music is dirt cheap and readily available.  A few people had obscure pieces I will check out over the weekend,  mainly guitar in a small group setting (duo, trio etc).  Should I limit myself to solo stuff now?  
	Anyway, I'll continue to poke around the U, and grab what I can.  The Tarrega is good stuff; lots of rhythmic interest, kinda pre-Astor Piaziolla (or however you spell his name).  Incidentally, one of the pieces in the Tarrega collection I'm trying to track down was the theme from "Don Juan de Marco" (recent Brando movie, I think), so maybe we can throw that on the web page.  

	..and that's the latest.

Hi Marlin,

	Here are the last two guitar tab pieces I've finished.  One's in the pop tune format often seen in the guitar mags, the other is a Bach piece I arranged from Sunhawk's library.  I'd appreciate any feedback, particularly on the latter.  Both were done in build 117i.  Thanks!

Hi Marlin,

	I came in this morning and found one of your strings broken on the guitar, so I bought more at the local guitar center.  When I was changing them, I noticed a crack in the headstock that was reacting to my tightening the strings.  Was this already there?  Thanks.

That certainly puts it into perspective.  Glad to be part of it.  I'm sure some Balinese and Moroccan performance practice will fall in there somewhere? ;) (One of my main interests as a composer)  So I can see what you meant when you kept saying 'you're thinking the wrong way'!  See you soon.

Hi,

	Checked 4 different versions so far, and wouldn't you know it: the fourth one had an F nat!  I dropped it after 2 versions, think it was intentional..

Hi Mary,

	I need to know how many vacation days I have, and if it's OK to take an additional one for this week.  Moving was more hectic than I thought, and getting the computer up and running didn't happen until Wednesday.  Thanks!

Hi Mary,

	I was sick two days this week, and these are usually 10 hour days for me.  This is why you'll see 10 hours on two days for my time sheet.  I assume it will take 2.5 sick days?  Thanks!

Hi

	Been trying to call you at work, but I keep getting 'your call cannot be completed as dialed'??   Leesa has friends in town from ariz., we're taking them to Snoqualmie today and Rainier tomorrow.  Been sick and it's the first week of school, so...   Talk to you soon?  Oh yeah, the bike center guy was kinda spacey but a nice uy all around!  Your old partner?  Wow, I thought he only knew you as the manager of another Bicycle center store...  Call if you get the chance, I should be here (work) until 3:00 or so.

It'll be ready this week, I guess.  Not really sure.  We all high-tailed it to the bar, though the rest was a bit more interesting, judging from the rehearsals.   A good night overall, I was really glad everyone came.  Too bad no Grecth..

Hi Mary,

	I have a few questions:

	1)  How much Vacation and Sick time do I currently have?

	2)  I recently received the stock option offer, and wish to purchase shares by taking a percentage out of my check each pay period.  How do we go about doing this?

	3)  I would like to increase the amount of fed. withholding on my check; I don't want to have to pay next year!  

Thanks,

Ben

Hi Mary!

This is heather writing from Ben's computer to ask you if it would be in the best interest to rent 2 - 10" X 10" canopies for the July 31st beach party. We are thinking that we need some area where people can get away from the sun and also these might stake out a place for us on the beach. That way a few people could get there an hour or so early and set up the canopies to reserve space. The parks department cannot reserve beach space, only picinic area, which costs over $100 and doesn't seem necessary. The canopies cost $65 each (2 total) plus tax. 

What do you think? We need to reserve soon if we decide to go for the canopies. Either way you can email ben back and he can let me know! thanks a lot.

(MY computer is down)

Heather

>Hi Erica,
>
>	Here is the big email to hopefully clear up all of the confusion about the guitar pieces.  There are a few confusing issues, due partly to program error and partly to the crowded nature of the music.  Please keep these things in mind before you get frustrated with anybody.  :)
>
>	1)	The raw we are using is ANCIENT, and rife with error.  I'm the only step between the book and the subslot; I have to hand enter, finger, correct (alot of that here) and then recheck.  I'm sure you can relate to the burnout potential here; remember the christian music of late?  :)  So, there are definitely going to be mistakes.  I'm sorry. :'(
>	
>	1a)	To underline the error/burnout issue: this is my first time entering this stuff, and I'm making a lot of mistakes.  Sorry!  Sorry Craig!
>
>	1b)	Also, since the raws are ANCIENT, I took some liberty with things like stem angles.  I think the way the stems are in most of these pieces are indicative of what usually goes on in guitar notation.  I know it's different, and I feel like I tried to warn everyone at the meeting in which I gave my 'seminar', but I guess it didn't take.  (why am I not surprised??  :)  So, I'm leaving a lot of these that you circled.  Please see the individual documents, and please trust me.
>
>	2)	The tab code in the editor is REALLY buggy.  This last build is the first time it's been given any kind of priority since like 104d!  There are a lot of bugs which, per Brent, Judy, Marlin, and me, we are going to live with.  These include:
>
>		- inconsistent tab numbers: the font is bold or not bold at random times.  I can't find a pattern to it.  We can't fix it unless we go through each number right now to check, since eyeballing is too 'iffy'.  So, we leave these.
>		- tab numbers lighting up at the wrong time: I can't remember if you or Craig brought this one up, but it's a bug and we're going to publish despite it.
>
>		- the formatter does weird things when tab is there.  I can't be much more specific than this, but it's to blame for some of the things you pointed out.  Please keep this in mind.
>
>	3)	On many of these, you say to put 'guitar solo' at the beginning of the piece.  When you asked me about this last week, I said I have never seen it this way in any other publication, and suggested we didn't put it there.
>
>
>	I'm trying not to be defensive, and hope I'm succeeding.  I really missed some simplicities in these and I'll get better at it as I keep entering these by hand.  I have to say, though, that I read a little condescension in the notes to me and Craig about this, which I can't imagine is intentional.  If someone asked me, "how 'bout that Erica?" I could only say, "She loves me.  She loves us all!  She comes in at 5am shouting 'Go Sunhawk!' at the top of her lungs daily!"  
>	
>	Ok you get the point.  Let's talk about these and get 'em up tomorrow, ok?  It's a high priority according to Brent and Judy, and I've been given permission to call some shots as far as these go.  "push them through" was the original wording, I think.  I grabbed all of the Sor pieces off of your desk and will fix everything tonight.  See ya tomorrow!

Hi Misako,

	I talked to Ian a moment ago, and he told me you were having problems with tab numbers appearing incorrectly on the tab staff (often much higher).  The problem arises from the connection between the tab staff and the normal staff whose notes the staff reflects..  
	Do you have the manual?  If not, please download it.  Look in the procedures index>guitar notation>tablature, and review the procedures for inserting a tab staff into a score.  
	Basically, when you connect the event list of a tab staff to a normal staff, the clef of the non-tab staff is transposed down by an octave (-12 in the edit box).  This is because the guitar sounds an octave lower than written (!).  So, the problem with those poorly-numbered staves is that the code somehow forgot to transpose the treble-clef-staff.
	Hope that clears everything up.  Call or email with any ?s.

Whooooooaaaa!!!!  I was just thinking about you the other day!  What goin on.  Yep, I'm going to the u (double degree: music theory/composition) and chain to a desk at a pretty cool job (as you'll see below).  What have you been up to???
	I'm not in a band anymore, but have been writing a lot of music, mostly for other people to play.  Mainly Film stuff... I scored a silent movie this past summer for the Grand Illusion in the U dist, and score all of Andy's stuff (you probably didn't know my brother was a 'local independent blah blah filmmaker', so that's what he's been doin).  I'm also putting a record out in June (hopefully) of a bunch of home recorded stuff.  It's goin pretty good.  
	Where are you at?? What are you doing?  How is everything?  Didn't you marry the guy from 'Devastationwagon' (possibly THE band name of the Century)?  How's that?  So, answer soon, and we can drink coffee or somethin.  Are you at the u too?  How the hell did you find me??

Note the pro, job-required sign-off below,

Wowee you sent me that last message and it totally freaked out my email program.. look below..

So, let me reply..

Hmm..  I guess you wouldn't say anything about your 'spy' ONLY if it was Steph, so I guess it's steph.  But it could also by Tom Costa or Ryan Newman so I don't know.  I thought she was out of the country and married, so what do I know?  Or maybe..  No you said it wasn't Claudine, so...  

I don't know what the Romey and Michelle thing is, so I can't be scared.  Sorry. :(

Yes the near miss was a horrible grief-ridden time and I came out feeling a lot older than any of my friends, so I was pretty isolated (seriously hermit kind of isolated like didn't see anyone but the family for like 6 mos.) and then came out a new man.  The obligatory 'dark night of the soul' that all creative people are supposed to have.  Anyway, I'm with a dyno-woman now and the romantic thing is the least of my worries.

I will tell Matt about the reunion, and I'm dissappointed I didn't hear more screaming from you!

So, since you're fading, you should reread my email and answer all my important questions!  >:<  And no, you're not boring me.  I assume I'm not boring you...?

So, give a call or let me know when you want to do coffee or whatever.  3644651  And we can't talk forever on the phone cause then we won't have anything to catch up on at coffee.

Did you notice the time on this emaiL??  I just got here after 10 hours of class/lab time (and yes, all music except Arabic for 2hrs) So I'm really delirious.  See ya michelle.  Call. Dont forget.

Hi Mike,

	Hey!  Great feedback. I am in no way in touch with this part of the literature the way you are, and your comments really help.  I don't know if I have enough to go on to know the tempo changes and subtleties in polymetric organization you speak of which are unique here, but I'm a little more aware.  If you could email me what you finish, it would help.  Sorry about the bad notes and what not - it helps to know what I missed.  Please comment on what you can when you send the 'final' edition.  Thanks again.

Ben

Hi Mike,

	This is a new composer tune, done in 111a.  The composer ammended his raw file, which was sent to me via snail mail, not over email.  So, the raws I am attaching aren't entirely accurate, I guess, according to Judy, we look at them and pass them on to her/the composer with our approval. I mention all this because there ARE a few discrepancies - call if necessary.

Hi Ben,

Here's the top half of the score (pgs 1-74).  I hope that you can get the
extractions done.  I crashed.  It just takes so long on my machine.  I know
that you have faster machines there.  Can you try the flutes and let me know
if you can extract.  I'm working in build 117e.  Good luck!

Hey,

Hey!

	I looked at the first two pages, and can't find any weirdness; can you be more specific?  The first page is fine (that's eadgad, bottom to top), the grids look ok.  Where does he have a problem?  
	Things I'd double check: that the treble staff for the tab staff is down an octave (-12 in the shift part of the edit box), and that the tuning objects are set right and connected on all staves -- not just the first one.

See ya!

Our view on this, so far, has been to leave it unlinked, therefore achieving a four bar rest.  Anyone else?

Well, in theory, it should make a "guitar fret noise' sound, but right now (118y!) it's resting...

Hi Miriam and Jennifer,

	Just a note to introduce myself. I'm a 25-year-old nearly graduated Music Theory student/composer.  I'm in Seattle -- I understand some of the other editors are distance... are you guys?  
	Feel free to send questions regarding the editor/layout issues and I'll do my best to answer them.  Looking forward to working with you.

Hi again,

	A couple things on p. 57: the accent marks in the bottom system should be linked to the notes in the chord.  Otherwise they fly away when I format the page.  Also, when you have a vertical squiggly indicating an arpeggio, double click on it to pull up the edit box, and please change it to 'segmented arpeggio'.  
	This is a little less obvious, but something you should keep your eyes peeled for.  In sys 4, second bar, right hand, the second and fourth beats needed triplet marks, invisible ones.  This creeps up alot in this book ou guys are editing. Thanks!

Hi you two,

	I thought I should point out a couple of things on p. 40 that were missed or you might not be aware of.  Please compare my version I attached to what you've got.

	Invisible rests/notes: If a note is invisible, and you add a dot, it isn't automatically invisible.

	On this page there are a few measures with nothing in 'em i.e. top of the page, 1st meas.  Please make sure the event lists for these measures are 'notated time'.  Get back to me if you don't know how to do that.

Thanks,

Hi,

	Did you guys know about the 'character map' tool windows has?  Go down to the 'start' icon in the lower left-hand corner, to programs, to accessories, and it should be there.  You can find out the alt+codes to the accents and whatnot found in some of the foreign text in these pieces.  

	For example, the u in 'piu' in bmqv1_05, second system, is obtained by holding down the alt key and hitting '0250'.  You can find these in the character map tool by clicking on the character you want -- the key sequence will show up in the lower right corner of the window.  Make sure you have 'times new roman' selected for the font.

Stop the presses!

	One thing I need you guys to do: before you save the final version of the files you send me, go under tools and select 'remove scans'.  This will make the rms file you save contain only the rms info, and not the raw.  This way, the rms files will take about 2/3 of the time they now take to send via email.  Thanks!

I'm in the composition program, so I write for whoever I can get ahold of at school.  If I'm scoring, It's usually myself on many instruments, a horn section I hire, and Andy, Matt, and a few others to help me out.  Andy isn't much into horror anymore, as far as making movies goes.  I call his stuff (this week anyway) white trash existential comedy.  If that works.  He is a genius and I intend to ride his pathetic coattails for all they're worth!!

Hi,

	As far as I know, he has no email address.  I periodically check the 'upic' site for updates.  Do a search on 'upic', X's elec. music system.  Last time I checked, though, there was simply contact info. for the studio.  
	There is pitifully little on the web, but I posess some key texts.  He has written two books, very useful for understand his music up to the early seventies, as well as numerous articles, particularly for 'Perspectives of New Music'.  Recently, a book of interviews was publish, which I acquired from amazon.com.  This proved to be the most accessible read I have ever had on the man.
	As I said in my email, I plan to organize something over the summer, as soon as the school year is complete.  Check back with me in September! :)

Hi all,

	Sorry I haven't been able to respond to your posts, Bill.  School just begun and there was a composition portfolio review. ACK!

	In response to your reaction to my intro:

	1)I'm going to the Univ. of Washington.  Jonathan Bernard, Prof of Music Theory, is a faculty member there.  I studied post-tonal theory, schenkerian analysis and Ligeti's comp techniques with him.  I feel very lucky to have done so; a remarkable instructor.

	2)Why do you consider yourself 'outside' of the musical establishment?

	3)I haven't read the entirety of all your posts, but I think you would be interested in the music of Webern and his followers, notably Boulez.  I believe the transformations and manipulations you wish to enact upon sets/set theory have been addressed, although perhaps at less length.  I have only dabbled in this, since I believe it to, ultimately, be a dead end compositionally; that is, you can only do so much with it (like canon!).  
	You are attempting, as far as I can surmise, to mechanize the contour of your music.  This has got to part of Boulez' thinking in regards to Le Martre..  He ordered and controlled all aspects of the piece serially; a closer look at the piece may find contour to be part of the plan as well.  You should familiarize yourself with the existing repertoire--it may save you time!! :)
	Let me add that I like the 'intuitiveness' of your approach, but think you can economize your explanations and gain more ground if you know what all has been done.  The theory books DON'T cover it all, as I'm sure you know.  Let me know if I can assist in any way.
	I think you should also check out Charles Seeger's writing.  He had amazing ideas far ahead of his time, yet not always in the 'serial' realm of thought.  Since his wife, the composer Ruth Crawford Seeger (check out her 1st string quartet) developed the idea of Dissonant counterpoint (which has elements of you theory in it), I suspect there would be something there for you.

	4)Regarding Boulez: I am also more intune with his conducting than composing.  However, the hammer without a master is an interesting piece in regards to it's organization, spoken of above.  See if you can't find an analysis already completed (check out the local list of dissertations) and look to some of it for your theory.

	5)You don't have access to compositional resources???  No paper and pencil?? ;(  Why?  What do you mean?

	6)Forgive me for talking so much!

Ben

To format one sys:
	1) select the system icon for that system,
	2) Hit ctrl+f

	This procedure applies to anything you may deem 'formattable'.  Try it after selecting beams, slurs..  A very useful tool!


>>>>2. How can one determine the rastral size of a staff that has been created

	Comparison with the original is usually the best method, HOWEVER, 4 and 5 are generally used for piano/piano and vocal/'3 staves or less' pieces.  
	Rastral 6 and 7 are reserved for pieces with greater instrumentation.  In general, try to stick to 4, moving to 5 only when necessary -- it buys you a bit more room.


	Do I need to look at the piece still, or do you have more ?'s  ???    Talk to you tomorrow.

You're in 118w now?  I elieve it is more related to your machine speed and the vers of windows you use.  Is it NT on the box you use?  There are bugs in Solero related to the painting of fonts onscreen in 95 and 98, as I mentioned on the phone.  Lemme know.

Hi Nick,

	In editing a piece, there are missteps which fall into three categories: Visual, playback and internal.  Internal can refer to the plumbing of the piece, the way things are connected, a bug etc..  I'll answer your questions directly, then address each of these categories.

>>	Here is Blue rondo. I think it is almost finished, but there were a few
>>things. If you look at the scan on page 6, there is a coda symbol, and I
>>didn't know how you wanted that done. 

The Coda symbol can be found in the right click menu, under modifier->repeat sign.  Don't try to match the size of the original coda, but DO fit it in where the original shows it.  There appears to be ample room.

>>Also, there is an indication for swing.
>>How do you make the 2 8ths = triplet quarter/triplet eighth? How do you make
>>the quarter = dotted quarter? And How do you make the coda sign at the end?

Achieving swing playback is done note by note.  I've attached a tutorial written by another of our editors, which should clear things up.  Let me know of any confusion.

>>Also, there is a weird rhythm problem on page 5. If you listen to it, you will understand what I mean. 

In the edit box, there is a space for 'numerator' and 'denominator'.  The numerator is the number of notes USUALLY in the space you're dealing with, the denominator is the number of of note PLAYED IN THAT SPACE.  So, here you want two notes in the space of three, so numerator=3 and denominator=2.  

>>Also, I do not know the copyright information for this song, for it is cut off on the scan.

Please paste the text which I've sent you at the bottom of page 1, and put three 'dummy' lines above the text, as in the attached bbluero2 I'm sending back.  Thanks!

>>If you could send me another file with
>>all those items like the coda sign, quarter  = dotted quarter, and so forth,
>>that would be great. 

I'll letcha find 'em in the menu; the sooner you become familiar with the right-click menu, the better! :)

So, Visual:
1) the ties and slurs need to look more consistent, and cannot collide with other objects. There are many collisions between the end of a slur and a staccato.  This is sometimes more obvious on a printout, so checking a printed copy for look, as well as against the original, should be part of your finish editing process before it gets to me.
2) On page 1, there seems to be a bit much white space.  I think spreading the staves out, as I've done on the copy I'm returning, will help.
3) The font size of the tempo mark (quarter=180) shoudl be separate from markings such as "lively", so the unattractive result on page 1 here doesn't occur.
4) If staccatos are on the same horizontal line, as many are on the first page, don't shy away from aligning them with the alignment tool.  

Overall, things need to look more consistent before I can pass this on to be published.  Don't sweat it though, you're doing great and learning a lot of things as we go on!

Playback:
1) There is an entire bar in error on page 1.  Please play through and check notes thoroughly against the raw before you pass it on!  Otherwise, we look bad. ;)
2) Note the i-let stuff I mentioned above.  Shouldn't there be a ritard there too? 
3) The swing stuff mentioned above also should be carried out in the swing sections.  The file I attached should prove very helpful.

Internally, things look great!  Let's finish this, then get on to the next piece.  I check email constantly, so you will get quick answers to the issues in this piece. Take care, and let me know if I should get on the telephone with you.

Boy he doesn't know how to haggle!

I guess I was anticipating another bid.

Before I say yes:
1) I don't want to make you typ ein the 50 carts, (unless you already have - please send) but hope they include adventure, riddle of the sphinx, and adventure.

2) How much is shipping?

Thanks,

Hi,

Hi novel folk, 

	I'm new to the list, please forgive if this is 'against protocol': I wanted to share part of a mushroom trip with you all and maybe get some answers/response of some sort.

	I'm 25 and pretty green (in the 'naive' sense of the word - how did that ever happen?) as far as hallucinogens go.  I'd done, at the most, 5 hits of acid at once, but relatively little mushrooms (maybe 1/2g cubensis).  Anyway, four friends of mine and I each took 1/2g cubensis, and began to enjoy...
	We were enjoying the dusk sky in our backyard, listening to Marvin Gaye, and I was dancing a little, just rocking on my feet back and forth.  The rest of the party were on some nearby wood steps, laying in each other's laps, forming a line of people down the steps.  I was surprised to feel a gentle but definitely involuntary spasm in my legs.  The guy at the top of the stairs felt it to, and claimed to 'perceive' (he didn't elaborate) it moving toward me.  Well, it took me for quite a ride.  
	I don't want to use the word 'spasm', because they weren't painful, and I could stop them if I tried.  Nevertheless, I felt an electrical stream of muscle contractions move smoothly through me at a high speed, as if I was a 6'2" whip.  Now, we were all very hip to Terence at the time, having recently watch the 3 or 4 vids we could get ahold of, reading True Hallucinations, and listening to him on Art Bell's show, so I decided to let go and let this thing, whatever it was, do its 'thing'.  What I began to perceive were nodal points (harmonics) within the whipping 'wave' motion, which, once I calmed things down as much as I could (hard to do once I had let go), began to 'hum' with a sort of 'equilibrium'.  I'm sorry to be vague but it's one of those things you can't quite stick words to.
	At any rate, my question is this: Does this sort of thing ring a bell with anyone?  Is there a label for this 'wave energy'?  I'm a composer and I was hoping to compose on this experience, given a concrete reference to the energy.  I might add that it always seemed to originate both from below my feet and from my head, as if there were two waves with some cancelling out happening; this is whether I was standing or laying.  Or were they 'just really good mushrooms'?

	Thanks for reading, sorry if that was long winded.

Hi Christopher,

	Here is a message I sent Don about that website we spoke about:



	Here's what you need to do in order to get the realaudio thing going on your computer.


	http://www.maltedmedia.com/kalvos/
	(bookmark this)

and click on the 'ourshow on audionet' link in the lower right hand corner.  This will give you the link to the realaudio site.  there, you should download the realplayer, install it (you will probably have to close all apps, including netscape), and follow the directions.  Then go back to the kalvos and damian page.
	At the bottom of their audionet page, there's a 'playlist' button.  This gives you a guide as to what tunes were played when, and who composed them.  They are grouped, I think, in seasons (winter '97, etc).  Go back to that audionet page, click on K&D's picture, and it will bring up a list of links for each show.  Realplayer will automatically open.


Chris:
I hope this helps.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.  In the meantime, here are some other web things you might want to look at:

The just intonation network:

http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/


A new music page which Charles Amirkhanian (sp?) is somehow affiliated with:

http://www.otherminds.org/

The society for electro-acoustic music in the US (SEAMUS):

http://comp.music.lsu.edu/seamus/

And of course:

http://www4.ncsu.edu/~bwmott/www/2600/

See ya Monday!!

Thought you'd be interested to see what's on This Amer. Life on 8/8 (KUOW)


        "Truth and Lies at Age Ten"
        When he was ten years old, Dan Gediman was cast in the public TV show "Zoom." Then he was cut from the cast. So he started
        lying about it. He let friends believe he was on "Zoom." In this special half-hour story, Gediman tracks down the original "Zoom"
        cast members, to find out what his life would've been, if he had achieved his childhood dream of being on "Zoom." And other
        stories. August 8, 1998.

Hey Paul,

	The CCCP got offered one of these lunchtime concerts at Benaroya on 9/24 at noon-12:45.  UW says "Not on our percussion instruments!",as does the SSO. So we need help.  
	I'd love you to play on my piece.  I was goin to offer $50 for cartage, if you can get ahold of the instruments.  Is this reasonable?  Please answer honestly, and know how much I appreciate all you've done as it is.  Thanks!
We'd need the following equiptment:

	Three toms
	Brake Drum
	Two Crash Cymbals
	Two Rides
	Two Triangles 
	Brake Drum
	Snare
	Wood Blocks
	Vibraphone
	(This is the list for my piece)
	...and one or two tympani (Chris is getting back to me on this one)
 
Thanks baby!

Hi Paul,
	
	You should experiment with the duration in the edit box for the appog's in question.  The default is 48, I think.  This can sometimes eat up the total duration of the note you are connecting the appog's to.  For example, 7 times 48 equals 336, and a quarter equals 384, which leaves 48; all the notes will have the same dur.  I usually half all of the appog. notes to 24, which sounds a bit quick to some, and just right to others... depends on the situation.  Experiment a little, but I think halving them is a good idea.  
	I too edited a few Chopin with similar situations; if you want to take a look lemme know.

Hi,
	I think you should copy the text out of the edit window, instead of copying the object.  Copying and pasting objects, especially between documents, isn't entirely dependable.

Yeah, you gave me the address at the croc.  The line was actually all black chicks waiting for some after hours thing - Lees didn't wanna hang.  (just kiddin there) So we missed the whole thing!  We caught em last night though and LET ME  TELL YOU... Dynamite!  These kids had old military stock footage they were showin and were real tight.  Good stuff.  Well I gots to get loose so I can bring home the bacon - see ya Friday.

	So what's the pass?

Hey,

	Did I ask you about keeping an eye out for a washing machine?  We have the hookups in the new place, but no devices.  My neighbor Chuck gave me a dryer, so I'm halfway there.  I thought you might know someone at work...

Thanks for getting back to me.  I need you at 8pm on the 21st, and want to do four rehearsals.  It's not that the parts are incredibly difficult, but the piece will take a bit of tightening.  Thanks!

Hey,

	Here's what you need to do in order to get the realaudio thing going on your computer.


	http://www.maltedmedia.com/kalvos/
	(bookmark this)

and click on the 'ourshow on audionet' link in the lower right hand corner.  This will give you the link to the realaudio site.  there, you should download the realplayer, install it (you will probably have to close all apps, including netscape), and follow the directions.  Then go back to the kalvos and damian page.
	At the bottom of their audionet page, there's a 'playlist' button.  This gives you a guide as to what tunes were played when, and who composed them.  They are grouped, I think, in seasons (winter '97, etc).  Go back to that audionet page, click on K&D's picture, and it will bring up a list of links for each show.  Realplayer will automatically open.


	About CM:  try

ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu:/pub/Lisp/cm/binaries/

	and see if xcm-ppc.sea.bin isn't an executable.  Otherwise

ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu:/pub/Lisp/cm/

	has a file called xcm.sea.bin, but I think the ppc one is the right one.  

... some time later...

I'm looking around and realizing these probably aren't them (only the latter could be, right?).  I'll keep checkin if I have more time to kill at work! 

See ya

	Sorry about the miscommunication; Gary instructed me not to link instrument names on the Art of Fugue pieces, saying the 'instrument #1' etc was sufficient.
	
	On the issue of ties and slurs, I will make an effort to be more in line with your distances, but I think I had a little farther away in mind (boy this gets nit-picky, eh?) and Gary hadn't said anything previously, hence my resubmission.  Hope we can post it and get onto the next one!  :)  

	I also wanted to let you know that the .doc files are TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL!  Thanks so much.

Ben

Hi Rick,

	A few points on your .doc:
1) This is the first time I've been instructed to use Pitch Freeze.  What does it do?
2) .raws are on the way from now on
3) Couldn't get the treble clef error, and I definitely song rendered...
4) Why the inv. barline?  Laziness I guess.  I had to format score complete, and it gave me tons of re-drawing to do.  I got burnt out after a while.


This should feel a little better.  

Ben

Hi Rick,

	When I started, I was sent a cd-rom, which contained all the workspaces my 1st-passers were editing in (incl. .raws, of course).  This took a fraction of the space available on the cd.  I think all that would have to happen is you would call Tacoma and ask for everyone's .raw files to be thrown on a cd-rom.  Seems worth it to me if Gary's going to be gone for a few weeks, eh?  Beats waiting for the email to load.  :)

Hi Rick,

	As far as the copyright is concerned, I used the fax Glenda sent me, and copied everything from it except the song title, the recording ('recorded by jewel on atlantic records') and 'words and music by ...', which is already at the top.  What am I missing?  Should it be justified the way it is on their sheet?

	Sorry about the pitch freeze (!), and the tempo.  I have a glitchy situation on my box that Brent can't recreate on his box: I can't edit tempo marks of any kind!  So, sorry about the lack of tempo marks and rit. marks!  We're working on it...

Hi Rick,

	First off, the copies of the Scharwenka and the Gabriel-Marie (Marie Gabriel; Jessica in Tacoma and I found her in one of their dictionaries with this piece listed in her entry) which you returned to me are finished, so one of us completed them!

	I attached the Moszkowski-sorry about the 1's!!!!  I'll get it through my head sooner or later.  The timing on everything is fine (you asked for my ok in a few of the docs).  

	I understand you're really busy; let me know if I can help!  I just hope you got all my pieces!At 01:19 PM 9/11/97 -0700, Richard Byrnes wrote:

Hi Rick,

	Thanks for the feedback.  You're right in saying I'm trying to put myself in your shoes - the 'slot' shoes - since I understand the slot is soon to be a rotating position.  I assume you carried out these changes, since all the comments are past tense "adjusted slurs" etc.  Could you send me a copy of the updated file, and, just to double check, tell me what files of mine you have in the queue from me, so I know you've received them.  I'm currently waiting on word about 6 tunes.  Thanks so much!

I completely understand.  I would like an acknowledgment, since I feel the email system isn't entirely dependable, and file managment errors on both our ends are possible.  Bad idea?  I'm not sure.

Hi Rick,

Hi,

	Do I call you Richard?

	Thursday after class (4:00) sounds good for me.  Is it still good for you?  You were going to confirm it via email, and let me know if we're talking THIS thurs. or next.  I'll do what I can to get to the seminar, but I have work scheduled then -- I should be able to show up to a few sessions.

Thanks again,

Hi,

	I just received an email from Tim Salzman asking me to play for Wind Ensemble.   This is right after class on Tues and Thurs, so those times are out.  I've got the following times available: MWF, 10:30-12:30 (though I will have to shuffle things for Friday to work, so THIS friday is out), TTh 9:00-12:30, 1:30-2:30, 5:30-?.  If need be I can make time in the afternoon on MWF, but this is my least favorite time.  :) Thanks.

Hi Richard,

	We were planning on getting together at the piano briefly after class to look at some of the aspects of my piece... so I'm reminding you of that.  Also, I spoke with Beth in the advising office about independent study, and she said it would cover my credit requirement.  Perhaps we can discuss this as well. Thanks!

My cousin's 1.5-year-old just started forming words, and I want to include it somehow in my piece; the problem is, I can only record her on a noisy cassette.  ??

Hi!

	Hope the summer's going well.  Two things:

	1) How should I submit this paper?   I assume I'll attach it in an email, so I need to know which format you would like me to use. 
	2) The piece I worked on most of the year is actually getting played!  Sept. 10th in Brechemin by the group Sarah B. and some folks from Western formed.  Linda (our conductor), Christopher and Bret are involved as well, so I assume you have already heard about it.  The concert is at 7:30, btw..

	Talk to you soon, and let me know if you have time to meet about the paper and to screen a Tark film...

Ok, here it is.  I could only save as a word 6.0, so let me know if you can import it.  If not, I can send it as a plain text doc.  Thanks!
Also, in case you haven't heard, the concert is actually at the Greenlake Methodist Church, site of the SCO concert a few months back.  
See you soon!

Hi,

	Thanks for coming the other night, I look forward to the feedback.  I was wondering two things:

1) should I beef up the essay before school?  We never drew any specific parameters for this thing, so I wasn't sure how much I should've written.  I feel I really held back on the paper with the examples because I thought the concepts were what you were interested in.  I thought that part of the paper was solid, at least.

2)  Could we meet on Friday before/after lab this year? My alternate is after class on mondays.  

Thanks!

Can I talk to you after class Monday, or will you be gone all week?  The reason I ask is because we need to have our scores for Fall Proconart ready on this first Friday.  If not I'll just make a decision on what I should submit.  Thanks.

PS:  Didn't Gary give you a CD with the .raw files for everything?  You can have the Tacoma office burn you one...  It seems highly inefficient to send them over email.

Hi Rick,

	Here is another straight from the player piano.  The extra staves are there in order to maintain instrumental continuity throughout the piece.  I wired in a tempo of 120 at the top, but a bug in 105g makes it dissappear!  I also had to enter the copyright from scratch, so tell me if I missed anything.  The raw files are also included.

Thanks,

Hi Rick,

	Here is my work from the days I was out of touch.  I'm unsure of how to align text under the endings, on p. 3 of the Barcarole.  The 'u. 2.' and 'Fine' seem fine in the editor, but print out weird.  Suggestions?

	Also, when the slot position went to you from Gary, I lost track of a few files.  Can you tell me who is chekcing them?  I'm not sure where to look for this kind of confirmation.  Thanks!!

	One more thing: I haven't received a confirmation from you regarding the reply to your message about the Gabriel, Moszkowski, and Scharwenka.  They are all edited, and were at the time I received your message saying they were 'holding for re-edit' (save the Moszkowski, which I sent with my reply).  Did you get the reply?  The files which you attached to that message were completed.

Ben

PS if you need to call, my new # is 3644651.

Hi Robert,

	Here's my email.  One point I forgot to mention in person: I won't be in town (Home for Thanksgiving) this next week, so I will be absent from rehearsal Monday.  Thanks.

Hi,

	I was referred to you by Ian Dobson.  I'm a composition student in need of a vibraphonist and two percusionists (one a kit drummer) for a piece of mine.  It's going to be played at this quarter's ProConArt, on May 21st.  Your help would be much appreciated.  If you're interested, give me a call.  Thanks!

Hi Robbyn,

	I've got a prob.: I need to get my bass and amp to practice tonight.  Could you swing by here before dinner tonight by any chance?  If I could stow my amp in your trunk and bring my bass inside, I would be very happy.  Thanks!

Hi Robbyn,

	Do you have a copy of the Police tune - an audio copy?  The notation is really loose, so I would like you to look at both.  Thanks!

You betcha.  Porque, Rachi, and Fire down Below, right?  I forgot to ask you this on the phone: do you have any texts on/related to steel band music?  I would like to be a little more involved with what you guys are doing. :)  Arrangements are on the way.  Do you have any Lord Kitchner stuff we aren't already playing?  Bye.

Hey,

	Yeah, Ian IS out of town this week.  I have 6-8 as well, but I would double check with him - weren't they a little squirelly on time at first?  I assume he'll be back Sat., because he's been saying he's going to the Oregon Coast 'for the week' lately.  
	I think Ian may be giving me a ride, I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Ben

Hi Robbyn!!!!!

	I'm glad to see that the month is full for you guys, and hope everything is Kosher with the new bassist.  I met him and he seems really cool.  
	I thought this would be a good time to touch base!  I'm writing a lot and working on the infamous 'solo album', and getting parts ready for the premier of my first-ever chamber piece, to be played on 9/10.  I'll let ya know details as they arise.  I've still got your steel band info you lent me awhile ago, and one tape you had in your car, if you remember.  Of course you will get these back!  

	I'll be calling you guys when I start recording to have you play, if you busy folk are available!  Say hi to everyone.

In a two-voice context (in the right hand) such as this, there can be some confusion as to which voice tool gets linked to which line of music.  On page 3 it seems you were a little confused about what notes belonged to which triplet, which voice gets what notes, etc.  I attached an annotated (sp?) page 3, showing how we can fix these things.  Does this help?  Lemme know.  You will want to load your original in the editor as well and see exactly what I changed (especially the voice icon stuff) I think.  I hope it helps.  Everything looks great and is quick to layout - these are confusing little things that trip me up too.  Talk to you soon!



Thanks,

Great.  Stick with it.  I'm having lots of crashes editing with Jayne's and your stuff, and was hoping for an easy explanation - maybe I've got it with Jayne.

	Don't worry about 32 and 33, I guess the people in our Tacoma office edited those.  I am wondering about p. 29, though.  It looks like you may have sent it to me before finishing it.  Please send a finshed version when you can.  
	One thing on these 25opp files: go ahead and follow the considerations for the 
	Everythings looking great.  Was your vacation good?  I get to go next week - I can't wait!  Talk to you soon.

Hi Miriam,

	I haven't looked at 52 and 53, but there are still lots of errors in 51.  You may want to take another look at it and make sure it's the correct version of the file.  Thanks.

Hi Miriam,

	The last message I have from you is one the 9th. Thanks for resending these.  I have ran into mistakes with the email system before--two weeks ago my time sheet was sent, but not received!  That was a bummer!  Anyway, no worries about this.  I was just concerned that you maybe weren't error checking before you sent files.  Everyone's eyebrows go up when they see I debugged AND layed-out a page.  :)  Everything looks good now!

Ben

PS
Are you back now?

They ARE tremolos; specifically 'unmeasured tremolos'.  When you link these to all three noteheads (three in this case, anyway), the three beams spread out appropriately between the stems.  I was pretty surprised how easy this was.

Well, it IS a dotted quarter in the original!  ;)  You guys might want to try printing out the .raw file as well as having it in the background: this really helped me out learning the 1st-pass process.  I caught a lot of things I might otherwise not have.



I attached a copy of the edited version of p.56.  Please take the time to compare it to your 1st-passed page.  1) Double barlines: Sometimes the recognizer puts in two separate barlines, rather than a single 'double barline' object.  This showed right up in the error check; I thought you would've asked about it.  2) Whenever there is a 'dummy measure' (a measure that only contains key/time sig change, no notes) at the end of a system (sys 3), the final barline should be invisible as per the original. 3) in the bottom system, there was a piano mark and crescendo text treated as one text object, when one's text and one's a dynamic.  Important.

I really think the printing of the .raws would help -- I know this stuff is sometimes hard to see in the editor.  Thanks.

I usually shift-click until all noteheads which I want to change are selected.  then I hit selection-scale-.7, which shinks all the noteheads down.  you have to do the stems and beams separately, but it isn't nearly as problematic as grace notes!  Talk to you soon.

In that case, you Do leave it disconnected.  Sorry to 'flail' so much in my message, I was simply envisioning 40-some files with unlinked fingerings.. :)

Hello,

	As long as you are working, everything's fine.  The CD should be there soon enough.
	As far as the files go, I've been editing in 104c, so use the viewer from 104c for these.

Thanks!

Definitely make a separate folder ONLY FOR BUILDS!  This way no confusion occurs.  The med104d is the installation program/archive of the editor, viewer, and associated files.  There shouldn't be any confusion with the editor and this file, but keep it in a 'builds' folder to be sure.

Let me be clear:  It's FINE (capital f) with me if you stay in 87.  This way, all builds thereafter can be used for debugging files before they go to the website.  I understand later builds are easier in some areas to work with, so try another build, if you wish.  104c and d are the MOST stable now, please don't misread that as COMPLETELY STABLE.  
	Any given build is going to be risky in some sense.  Therefore, you have to a)always make a backup of the file you are trying for the first time in a new build, b) save OFTEN: I save after each system I edit.  Using the keyboard shortcut, Alt+f s , makes it less distracting.  A little experimentation, definitely allowed and ADVISED, will help you become more aware of any errors lurking ahead of you!

Try selecting all the notes you want to link to the fat lady, using shift+click, then link ALL of them to the fat lady.

Which pieces?  It looks like the parts are all one page, so far.  Let me know.

Also, for some reason, I'm getting the scan with your rms file, which takes WAY too long to download!  I think if you go tools-remove scans, and save before you send it to me, it will send just the rms.  God my English is so bad today, sorry.  Talk soon.  The parts look great so far - no wrong notes! :):():)

Hi,

	I'm looking through the emails you sent at the time the files I'm currently working on were sent.  (Got that? :)  Did I answer your question?  Everything, more or less, takes a title text object.  The exceptions are dynamics and... hmm... that's all I can think of right now.  Ask questions if any come up.


	Also, are there any plans to edit bmqv1_07.rms?  It's the last half of the piece which begins with bmqv1_06.rms.  Please refresh my memory if I spaced something.  :)

Why do you need to use the stamps?  I don't even know what they do.



Two additional things: 
	1) There are still TONS of section text object showing up, and you guys haven't said anything as to whether or not they're bugs or intentional.  Could you please let me know -- they take a lot of time to undo!  Thanks.
	2) The grace notes in bmqv1_13.rms are attached to the previous measure's event list.  They are supposed to be attached to the previous NOTE, but to the event list of the measure they appear in.

This isn't only for titles, but for ANY and ALL text.  You don't use section text at all: section text is used for repeating sections in midi playback (my job, you will be thankful :)   So, no section text, please.  I have to retype all the text objs that are section text, so it makes me cranky. :'(  Please make sure that we're all clear on this.  Do you guys each get a chance to read all the email?  Just checking.  :)

Hi Ryoko!

	I know I've been out of touch for awhile... school has been very hard and I got that great job I told you about.  Maybe I told you I already got it?  Anyway, I've barely had time to think. Once school's out, we'll have to hang out.   You have a physical problem?  What's the matter.  ("Phys. prob." in English is VERY vague :)  I hope to hear from you soon.

Hi Ryoko,

	Things are really busy.  All my tests are over, and they were pretty easy.  I have a few papers for other classes due Friday, though, and that's where it gets hard.  My girlfriend's ear are probably bleeding by now, since I've read one of the papers I'm writing about 500 times to her.  It's for a graduate level course, and I'm just an undergrad, so it needs to be really good!  Know what I mean?

	After this week, we can do some coffee again or get some food.  I told you about my new job, right?  I work from home on the computer, so I will be around A LOT!  See you soon.

Ben

Yep, the same one.  She's my best friend so it is hard to just drop everything.. You know what I mean.  No, I'm not out of the U yet, not until December. But I don't have much to do next quarter but work.

Hey!  Thanks for thinking of me, but I've kinda put bass down for awhile to pick guitar back up.  I'd like to play guitar with you guys (elec or acous) if you'll have me, but I'm off the bass for awhile.

I know I know I'm never at school (in the halls, at least) anymore...  I've been bad a skipped a couple of comp labs this quarter, and only have comp. music and conducting for classes.  I've been living in room 12 all quarter, though, so I've been just totally underground, man, like the whole quarter.  Beers are definitely imminent.  We should all go out sometime next week..

Keep me in mind for the group as a composer too!  :)

Thanks.

I guess I'd like to do either.  I don't have a whole helluva lotta time, but would like to compose something.  Also, you know, I'm interested in establishing some respect for the electric as an ensemble inst..  so.. I could do either.  You let me know, k?  PS: we're all going out for beers tomorrow night at the college inn at like 7, ok?  It's after our comp. music final, so we'll see how many people show up.. See ya!

Hey Sarah,

	I don't know if I'm going to be able to participate after all..  I bought tickets in May to go to New Mexico at the beginning of September, and have been trying to move them ahead to accommidate the concert, but it's proving too bug a hassle, especially in terms of $$$ (since I have to foot the bill for school next year), so we're stuck leaving the first week of September.  Should I still get the work together, or not since I'll be missing the concert and a rehearsal?

Ben

Everyone is scheduled to show up to the next rehearsal, and you guys said I could have more time than normal (like 45 mins) 
I'm going to ask everyone at the rehearsal for they're available time, and will try to rehearse them again before the dress..  I'm getting worried it might be buthcered. :(

Things are actually REALLY BAD right now, but thanks for asking!  Give me a call at work if you want to touch base about Heather/the rehearsal.  The only cellist I know of is Julie who plays in SCO, so if you haven't asked Christopher (which I'm sure you have), ask him for her #.  She's great.

Sarah:

	I had no idea that we were all on the programs for BOTH concerts, so I should tentatively say that my folks can't go.  I'm gonig to beg and plead today, but you can only expect so much...  :(  I really got left out of the communication loop on this stuff, so can we make sure we're on the same page tonight? Over the beers (still a go?)?  Take care.

Ok.  I FINALLY got into the composition program, and summer was pretty much the preparation for that.  Ummm...  Oh! Remember the Ramen Song I played for you guys?  Well, it's going to come out on a 45 (record) in a month or so, as soon as I figure out what song to put on the other side.  This job I got editing music is going really well, and pays well too.  
We all moved out of our big ugly/beautiful house.. that's probably the BIG NEWS.  Leesa and I are still together but not living together - I got a place in Wedgewood w/my friend Matt (I'm sure you met him at one of the parties) and Leesa got a beautiful place in Fremont.

Well...  For your info it happens to be Kobe (according to my roommate).  OK, now what was I supposed to give you in the email?  I forget now, which is of course due to my substantial drug and alcohol intake.  Hmm..  Do you have my number?  That must've been it: 364-4651.  Also, my new address is 10740 35th Ave. NE (98125).  
	So do you like the classes you're taking or not?  I'm taking Computer Music with Karpen and LOVE it.  It appeals to my geek nature highly.  By the way, did you take that music/math class from the Czech guy all the way through? Or did you drop it?  I wanted to see the syllabus if you have it.  

Emale.. very funny

Hi,

	I'm really sorry, but this just isn't happening this quarter.  I thought I'd be able to work it around my relocation at work, but the hours they need me are many and sporadic.  Sorry.  Hopefully, next quarter will work.

Hi,

	So am I participating in this now?  The last email you sent somehow got misdelivered, luckily to my boss (!).  My email is benmca@sunhawk.com or benmca@u.washing....  So what's up?  How'd the finals go?  I've kinda disregarded all the messages you've sent about the bham/seatlle thing because you initially said you would have to see what was up with the other composers, than you said "hmmmmm, perhaps to compose a 5-minute work, including electro with yourself playing?  would be the seattle group, yes?", which didn't sound like a 'fer sure' but like another maybe... So what's up?  It is early and I am jacked on the caffeine so, sorry for the blathering! :)  If you have time today, you could call me at work at 7480275, I'll be here until 6:30, and we could talk about all this.  Should I be panicking?  See ya..

Oops the caps lock was on.  My girlfriend reacted violently when I told her I might not be doin the concert (she really wants to here the piece), so I guess everything's gonna work out. Disregard the last message I sent. I have another question though:

I wanna bring in three outside players, so I need to know where exactly the concert is to be held.  They're 2 percussionists and one sax.  Thanks!

Talk soon,

Hi!

	Sudden flexibility has come up with my ticket for New Mex, so I can probably go to rehearsals and the concert if I plan things right.  So I need to know when my piece will be rehearsed and where exactly the concert is.  I need to modify my instrumentation, or at least verify that this is what I gave you:

Sax (I'm bringing)
Bass Clarinet (Does your Cl have one? Maybe you could give me his/her email. Otherwise I'm bringing this person)
Piano
Vibes (I'm Bringing)
Bass
2 Percussionists
(I'm bring one, Greg is playing the other part for Drum Kit.)

Sorry if I flaked on this before, but I thought I was adding a lot of extra stuff...  I need to know where things are for the two percussionists, basically...  Thanks so much!  time for beers?

Hi,

Shit...  uh... I heard on Art Bell the other night that there are looooowwww frequencies which reverberate in the chambers of the great pyramid at Giza.  One theory goes that when the pyramids were first built, and the sides were smooth (I'm not sure why that's important), the desert winds would blow across the air shafts in the pyramid, causing the reverberation.  This is the same thing that happens when you make a bottle sound by blowing across the top.  Incidentally, the note is F#.  I'd ask Terrence why F#, besides it being the alleged frequnency that the Earth vibrates at (WHY does it vibrate F# -- circumstantial?), and what could the purpose of such a setup (a structure vibrating in harmony with the earth) be.

Tom just bailed a few weeks ago to tour with Manah, and he should be back.  I tried to call the Ben guy a few times, but no luck.  I've been moving (10740 35th Ave NE Seattle 98125 2063644651) and have been a little out of touch.  I plan to call him this week.  School starts this week and I'm taking Arabic and maybe composition if they let me in and out in 2 yrs.  Big weird deal-the audition is Friday-I'll let ya know.

So besides what i said above everything's pretty groovy.  Lees found an awesome placein Fremont with Joy, Matt and I are diggin our pad, Andy live 3 blocks away... It's all pretty good.  I've been working on this string quartet for about a month - it's actually nearly finished! - and I found a quartet to play/record it for me!  
The Job scene is still cush.. I just a got a raise to $10/hr, which still ain't bad.  The music is a little more exciting.  But the big news is this, man..  I wrote this tune called the Ramen song a while ago... wait I think you were there when the guys (from the label who put out the Medicine Hat CD) said they would put out a single of that song, right?  Thought so.  I can smell the money burning already..

So not much else is up, cuz I've been recovering from moving all week.  There will be more cool stuff in about three weeks, since I'll be recording the string quartet (and maybe putting it on the other side of the single) and some airplay will happen.  I'm chillin, glad your chillin.

So what up with Erica moving out there?  Are you stoked?  I thought you couldn't trust here completely?  :)  Jus kiddin homes its your life, and I'm sure you'll be happier with her, right?  She misses ya alot, I know.  OK.

So let me in on all the hip happenins with all the crazy cool cats and kittens out there in cool cat land.  Especially kick down the Terence knowledge when it becomes available.  You are the shit man.  Keep it up.

Man that job shit bites baby.  I hope you two are happy... sad to see her go but you guys sound happy.  Papa loves constant booty..
	So what's it REALLY like there?  Quit it with this run-down shit, gimme the goods.  Is it too early to tell who's fulloshit and who ain't?  I got a feeling about people at the U that ended up being pretty right on, how bout you?
	The infrastructure at the U has given way finally and let me into the composition dept and it's like a whole new place.  Where I once felt like I was wasting my time, I now feel like I was meant to wait and sweat and THEN get in. Shit is jes' linin' up for ol Ben here..  S'cool.  Finished the String Quartet I was slavin over while you were staying with us, as well a guitar duet.  I'm workin on a chamber piece now. 
	See, I can't believe I am studyin with the guy I'm studyin with.  He's this guy, you may remember me tellin you, that had told me to write economically over the summer, and he'd bat for me when the audition came around.  'member?  K, so this guy's the computer music guy at school and I'm expecting Mr Stiff but he's fuckin BRILLIANT.  Up there with the X man, no shit!  I can't believe it either.  So the first lesson goes by and he instills all the confidence I need after seeing and giving props to this quartet I wrote, and now all we're talkin about is instilling the non-repetitive, intuitive flow of film into my writing.  Whoa.  I thought I'd be doing some sort of review ro something, but he thinks I'm right there, dig?  So I'm stoked...
	Built to Spill?  I didn't know they held such a mythic place in that head!!?  Med Hat played with Treepeople a coupla times, so I'm down.  They were pretty intense guys, but if you woulda said then that whathisname (Scott somethin?) was gonna form a band and call it built to spill, I would've expected something more weenish based on their personalities/tastes in covers.  Coo'..
	Matt says Hi (he's my roommate now).
	Weird ass shit bout the shamanic journey woman.  Keep my ign'r'nt ass posted on developments in this area.  
	So I'm tryin to type like I talk.. hope it's gettin out there.
	Lemme know what's up with the art, and what you're doing that way.  No one thinks you're an alien monkey boy over here.

Straight on, long and strong

Hey mang

	Sorry it took so long for me to get back eh but I'm in a fawking office now!!!!  I'm one of them!!!  So what's  up?  You doin finals?  Sucks.
	Gimme da schoo update.  Here its good, pretty much the same as in the last message.  One cool thing:  the Ramen single has turned into the Ramen ALBUM.  They want me to do a whole record for summer release -- I'm pretty damn stoked.
	I went to Arizona with Lees for Thanksgiving.. it was cool, but tripped.  The day we get down there Leesa's visiting nephew (age 12) hits the hospital bed with SPINAL MENINGITIS.  No shit.  So what a way to meet the family, right?  By Thanksgiving this kid was running around and breaking shit, though, so all went well.  The Grand Canyon blew me away, as did the incredible mass of STRIP-MALL-STYLE-ARCHITECTURE. Anyway.
	So you guys are in a sunny spot now but write or call when you get back.

Hi Scott,

	Sorry, but I forgot to put the parts in your box Monday.  I DID find two parts, one xerox and one orig. of the McTee, and one of the Grainger.  They'll be in your box tonight.

:)

 Tell me more
>about your last thoughts in the last sentence -- which repeated image,
>which other aspects and what's your thought about the analogy to orchestration?

Well, it's like this:  In a lot of modern 'serious' music (ligeti, varese, carter), the line between orchestration and melodic/harmonic movement is blurred.   That is, sometimes you encounter a melodic or harmonic element in a certain change (or sequence of changes) in orchestration (aka instrumentation here) and vice versa.  
	What I'm saying here, and in not answering the question I hope to emphasize the point, is that the asian music plays a dual role, orchestration and counterpoint.  The music is really low in the mix, and blurs the line between the previous scene (floating above the bed) and the oncoming closure.  So in this sense, it plays a literal orchestrational role: a blurry, ethereal sound, barely in the mix, seems to recall the previous scene while existing literally in the scene (it's coming from a's stereo in his bedroom).  
	This isn't the only way to read it, though, since Japan/Zen/etc is a powerful symbol in the movie.  It's a literal counterpoint in this sense, since the imminent closure will reduce A's life to a zen-like simplicity (which he strives for?) and that it has crept into the soundtrack at key times previously, thereby linking it to those.  
	I think tark is really a composer at heart;  he does everything in such an overtly musical way it's easier to link him to composer's stylistically rather than other filmmakers (for me, at least).  What music do you listen to?  Are the music references making sense?
  

	I'm swamped at work right now; I think that's everything I wanted to say.  Reaction?

Hello,

I am also new to the list.  I have looked at some of the archives but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for:

	I'm a Music Composition student doing an independent study of his films, particularly Solaris, Stalker and Sacrifice, and their structural characteristics.  His ideas easily apply to music, as I'm sure they do to other art forms.

I wonder if there aren't other artists on the list who consider T an influence, or who have done similar 'research'.  ??  

I would throw out as a discussion question the following:

Is T's pacing completely effective?  
  
	Why the long cat and mouse game involved in getting to the Zone in Stalker?  More generally, why the hypnotically long shots?  I am fully aware of the structural weight often involved, but wonder if others might argue his success when employing pacing in such a dramatic way.  Thanks for reading.

>TOEI MUSIC PUBLISHING (JAPAN):
>
>ANDREY TARKOVKSY: Vol. 1: Ivanovo Detstvo CD (TMP 2001). A series of 4 CDs
>(released in 1995, only in Japan) documenting the film music of the late,
>legendary Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-86). This first volume
>features soundtrack music composed by Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov. This one is
>only 27 minutes long, so has a cheaper list price. "Musically speaking,
>this CD has less of the Sound-Research evident in the latter two volumes,
>opting for a more orchestral approach. Not to say that there aren't some
>sinister drones and strange bursts of group-sound. There are some
>scathingly odd sections reminiscient of Jerry Goldsmith's film-work circa
>Chinatown (esp. in the taut piano figures), replete with dense clusters of
>sound. Firmly rooted in the post-1950 school of academic composition. 11
>Tracks." -- Hrvatski  $22.00
>
>ANDREY TARKOVSKY: Andrey Rublyov CD (TMP 2002). "A grimly realistic
>portrayal of a 15-th century Russian Monk which was made in 1966 but was
>banned in Russia until 1971."-- Ephraim Katz. Soundtrack by Vyacheslav
>Ovchinnikov. "Dark, atonal passages of repeating figures and isolated
>percussive elements. Some completely unrecognizable instruments, extended
>performance techniques reminiscient of Lachenmann's string pieces and
>Penderecki's choral work. Fairly jostling washes of sound. Ensemble playing
>mixed with field recordings of post-war machinery and plenty of tape hiss
>(or is it rain...), for that chain-dragging on the ground effect.
>Startingly AMM-like in places.  Serious rising sounds. 15 tracks." --
>Hrvatski  $30.00
>
>ANDREY TARKOVSKY: Solaris CD (TMP 2003). The 1972 SF masterpiece based on
>the Stanislaw Lem book. Strange, arcane, slow and beautiful, one of the
>quintessential "space" movies of the 70s and about as fine a document in
>the world of visual arts as you could ask for. Soundtrack composed by
>Edward Artemyev & Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov (uncredited). "Excellent
>long-reverb location-sound-collection not far from the Organum school of
>non-movement bliss. Mysterious. Comes as close to recreating in sound the
>whole 'space' experience as thought possible. Serious atmospherics (key
>word: dense). Reoccuring pipe organ theme. Dripping. Think of the best of
>the Mainstream-label catalogue.17 tracks." -- Hrvatski  $30.00
>
>ANDREY TARKOVSKY: Zerkalo/Stalker CD (TMP 2004). Soundtracks by Edward
>Artemyev. Zerkalo is from 1974 and Stalker is from 1979. "Artemyev's
>compositional ability is closer inspected here, in a much more varied
>assortment of musical cues than previous volumes. The Zeralko pieces are an
>eclectic assortment of low drones, ensemble systems-chaos, Handel
>influenced string interludes, kit-based space ritual chants, dawn-of-time
>instrument discovery, and one ethically challenging mariachi blast. But the
>real goods are delivered via the second (Stalker) half of the CD; several
>mellotron-bedded pieces involving SERIOUSLY echoplexed-out phase-synced
>lute/flute meditations relaying the order of the cosmos to each other over
>two channels, with underlaying sub-aquatic ambience and resonant
>synth-footing. Excellent stuff, a must-hear. Certainly the place to start
>with this somewhat daunting series. 21 tracks." -- Hrvatski  $30.00

>HOOD, ROBERT: Internal Empire CD (TRES 77 CD). "Internal Empire, is the

>released in 1994 and long unavailable, it's a Detroit classic of perfectly
>looping minimalist repetition. Hood has since released full length's for
>Cheap and Drama but this is his defining moment and one of the heaviest
>abstract Detroit records -- near perfect sound construction. "Robert Hoods
>official contribution to the music scene in Detroit at the end of 1990 was

Hi all,

	Incase you don't remember me, I'm a composition (music) student ant the U of Washington, and just finished an independent study on tark.  A couple of you had expressed interest in reading my paper when I was done, and I'm done!  Keep in mind, I'm just an undergrad... ;)
	Shall I put it in an email, or have people ask me for it?  Also, tell me, if you can, how those cd's sound.  Has anyone bought them from forced exposure yet?

Ok, so I'm a bit intimidated by all you tark buffs.  Be kind! :)  Here goes:


	There are several aspects of Tarkovsky's films which recur and brush the surface of the film with his signature.  Some of these concepts, which I've gleaned on my own from his work, have a musical quality; others borrow from the visual arts.  The most obvious aspect setting Tarkovsky apart is his use of time, in both his overall pacing and localized rhythm. That is to say, time is used on a macro- and microscopic level - consciously and gracefully.  In addition to the time aspect, Tarkovsky is prone to using sound and image in a musical way, in concert with his pacing and rhythm. 
TIME
	The pace of most (save Ivan) of Tarkovsky's films comes from his desire to manipulate the rhythm of his shots.   He often maintains a plaintive rhythm, which is countered by scenes of intense activity.  A scene with such (relative) quickness need not be shocking in the Hollywood sense; it will shock as a result of the rhythmic shift.  
	An example of this lies early in Sacrifice.  There is relative calm as everyone buckles down for the impending war, waiting for something to take place.  Nothing but hushed conversation has occurred until, quite suddenly, an extremely loud craft/missile (not quite sure) flies over the house.  The camera pans dramatically back and forth as members of the household run across the room.  The scene crescendos in a slowed shot of a pitcher of milk crashing to the floor from a high shelf.  Then there is calm.
	Though this is rhythm in a more localized sense, there is a formal 'rhythm' in his approach to structure.  Drastically simplifying the plots of Sacrifice, Stalker, and Solaris, one can readily see a common, grand gesture employed in all three:
	1) Long introductory sequence establishing characters/relationships
	2) Short, (sudden) action/busy development  
	3) Long undulation of the resolution
Solaris:
	1) Chris is told to go to Solaris and journeys there
	2) Chris comes aboard the space station, encounters crew and Hari
	3) The issue of Hari's existence is argued, until finally Chris's entire environment is reconstructed.
Stalker:
	1) Journey out of city and into the Zone, towards the room
	2) Several trials occur until the three fall asleep	
	3) The room is encountered, but the option isn't taken.  The three return to the city
Sacrifice: 
	1)  Conversation between Alexander and Little Man, Alexander's birthday celebration
	2) Fly-by, reaction of family, Alexander's appeal to God, visit to Maria
	3) Alexander burns house and attempts to flee

	This is, admittedly, an approximate form and is partially a result of traditional dramatic structure.  Looking at the sequence of scenes in my second section of each movie, one can see the action is much more intense there than in rest of the movie.  This isn't simply a formula he uses, but part of his 'musicianship' with the camera.  The audience is lulled into these sections slowly and out of them slowly.  I believe this to be in direct contrast to western cinema.  In the west, one isn't usually eased out of action, but is hit with another action, or given a resolution quite soon.  The same can be seen, in a shorter time frame, in the return drive to the city from Chris's parents cabin in Solaris, and the end of the chase when the three leave the city in Stalker.
	Tarkovsky's pacing creates a tension unseen in Western cinema.  For example, Scorcese's trademark use of time is the opposite of Tarkovsky.  A signature move of Scorcese's is actually the inverse of Tarkovsky's scheme: fast-paced-multi-edit action sequences which climax in slow-motion (Taxi Driver etc.).  Instead of the "silence.....blam!" strategy seen in so many horror and action films, or silence to convey a brief intensity, as in Scorcese, silence in Tarkovsky's work creates an expanding slow-burn of tension which grows with the progression of the movie.  Tarkovsky allows deflation of the tension only gradually, with little exception.
	Is the elongated section without interruption an effective contrast to these graceful bursts of action?  Are the formal proportions dealt these two concepts adequate for what Tarkovsky wants to say?  A few things get in my way when I ask myself these questions.  For one, I have to depend on subtitles for content, and have a feeling I'm often missing something.  I was recently told that there is tremendous significance in the introductory conversations in Solaris that aren't apparent in the subtitles.  There is, allegedly, foreshadowing in the opening, as Chris's mental state is discussed by his hosts at the cabin (parents or merely relatives?).  Also, I must depend on a video and TV for the presentation of the cinematography in his films, which I feel I miss when reading references to scenes in Sculpting in Time, especially in reference to Sacrifice.
COLOR/IMAGE/SOUND
	Though these are definitely separate aspects of Tarkovsky's work, color, image and sound add a structural weight which here unites them.  
	Color, and it's absence, is the most literal structural marker in Tarkovsky's films.  It gives the viewer information about the scene at hand, whether marking the wall between sleep and consciousness or restriction and freedom.  Sleep and wakefulness are marked by B&W/very washed-out color and color, respectively, in Sacrifice's dream sequences; restriction and freedom are marked this way in Stalker.  
	Structural weight is exercised through image by Tarkovsky in some very creative ways.  Repeating an image in more than one form, such as the many forms water takes in Solaris: running water in the opening and closing, the ocean on Solaris, and the use of rain.  These 'signposts' in the film lead the viewer in a poetic way which counterpoints the plot and action.  
	Another poetic use of image is the way Tarkovsky uses special effects, or rather, doesn't use them.  Special effects are used very sparsely in his films; the sections which in the west would virtually require special effects are conveyed through clever writing/filming and convincing performance.  Suggestion is a keyword here.  Examples abound: the swirled, filtered water shot is all we see of the planet in Solaris until the end, there IS NO visible alien presence in Stalker, no visible threat in Sacrifice.  The special effects, when they are used in this way, have an added impact not sensed in any movie which employs them throughout.  When Alexander and Maria float above the bed in Sacrifice, it's a VERY powerful image, in both the literal sense (the audience is very surprised to see such a literal special effect) and in terms of the plot (this is a major turning point in the film).  This "high-art through simplicity" imbues Tarkovsky's work.
	Sound, it can be said, is a shared endeavor by Tarkovsky and Artemeyev, but apparently Tarkovsky is giving the direction for the recording and editing of the sound.  Sound is used as poetically as image, and affects the perception of time in it's own distinct way.  In Sacrifice, Japanese music is mixed ever so slightly into the soundtrack throughout the film, most notably when Alexander visits Maria and as he leaves the house and burns it.  Obviously, this is musical in the same way the repeated image is; it counterpoints other aspects of the film the way voices interplay in music.  Or is it analogous to orchestration?
CONCLUSION
	Tarkovsky's work is powerful, and its power results, in part, from it's musicality.  The use of rhythm, image and sound to manipulate time lead the viewer through the film with a grace seldom seen in western cinema. 
	While it is unclear whether or not Tarkovsky was given enough freedom to easily execute his ideas in communist Russia, no limitations were endured; all were transcended.  His ability to make great art with an economy of means is a spiritual beacon for anyone struggling against material boundaries in their art.

Hi,

	The vocab quiz we took in between these (Chap 7) came back to me today with a retake suggestion also.  Boy am I bad at this!  So, hopefully, we can break these up.  I'll study for Chap 1-6, and hopefully we can do one or the both of the remaining ones on Friday or next week.  Thanks!

Hmmm...  I've never done the tape trading thing before.  If you're really into zappa I can xerox the score I have of 'dog breath variations', if you're into reading along.  Bootleg wise I have a boot ep of Fugazi, some Sublime (I think just unreleased bsides) as far as rock goes.  In terms of orchestral music, I've got Xenakis, Penderecki, and Boulez (conducted Perf. Stranger)some other modern composers.  These two are in the post-Varese school, so if you dig 'Naval Aviation...' or 'The Perfect Stranger', you might like these guys.
These recordings are all versions of pieces either a)no longer performed (especially in Penderecki's case) or alternate takes which usually sound better than what made it to the CD reissues (especially in Xenakis' case).
If you are willing to help me out, please let me know the protocol for tape trading and I'll rush something off..

Thanks a lot,

Hi,

	I sent you a tape with some contemporary classical, outa print performances, by Xenakis and Penderecki.  Lemme know if this qualifies me to pick something off of the list.

	Also, I remembered a two videos I have of Zappa you may be interested in.  One is his appearance on Satuday Night Live playing 'Heavenly Bank Account', and talking a little at the end of the show.  This is about 6 mins.  Then I have an '81 or '82 Halloween concert he never released, but allowed USA network to broadcast it.  Both, unfortunately, are mono.  Interested?

Hey moog,

	Glad you liked it.  I think I would also like

??/??/63 Metal Man Has Won His Wings 1963-74          n/a      M:D       B+     50  CAS     

(cut from you list, off the zappa section).  Please advise if I'm breaching the etiquette here, by bugging you for more, but I noticed you have a bunch of Dead Kennedys... any interest in Fugazi?  (Ian McKay from Minor Threat's band)
Four songs, 15-20 mins., sound quality b+ (I've got the mint vinyl, to which the recording was made.  Can't tell if it's audience or sbd, though.  Interested?

Thanks for helping me get started!

Ben

Hi,

	I won't be there today, but will be on Thursday.  I teach, and had scheduled a couple of lessons during the afternoon on Tues.  Also, there's a little BS to deal with at Schmitz, because there's a sched. conflict for me at this time.....  So, I guess I'll have something for you to sign.  
	Is there any way you could leave some music for me w/Sally?  Thanks.

Prof S,

	Sorry about the past two rehearsals.  The job I'm working is realy taking a lot of extra time right now, which is why I didn't sign up for WE.  I thought I had let you know in person that I would be there a minimum of once a week.  If I didn't, sorry -- it's been real hectic.  I'll be there today and we can talk a bit after.

Man, sorry for not replying!!  I've been so busy!  

	The arabic is finally over, but it was a slow, painful haul there for awhile!  The end of the quarter makes me pretty much finished except for some lesson credits I have to fill.  I'm only taking computer music and conducting next quarter. You?

	If by analog sound editing you mean tape splicing, no, I don't do that much anymore.  The computer makes it much easier!  I would check out the available sound cards and keyboard controllers as opposed to a MIDI keyboard, if you feel your computer is something you want to invest in.  You can see some full demos at American music on a Sunday afternoon.  
	We gotta have a beer at some point, and I gotta get my orange Distortion from ya.  Lemme know when you have some time.  Leesa moved to Fremont, so we're there a lot, especially at the Pacific Inn.  Talk to ya soon!

If all you got is a controller, cool.  There's some sort of card you can get for the Mac, analagous to a Proteus module or something similar, which gives you something like 500-600 orchestral sounds as well as cool unusual ones.  And of course, it's expandable.  I'd check that out if you get tired of the Yamaha sounds.
I've got a bunch of experience, but it seems that the systems get more complicated every year...  Let me know if you need anything.

Hey Travis!

	Here's the list of software I need on all PC's used by new hires:
Netscape
Eudora
MS Office
Winzip
Any Sound and Printer Drivers need to be installed; Heather and Dave's machines couldn't print when I left Thursday -- maybe you caught it on Friday?
...I'm sure I'll think of something else this morning.  Thanks!

Too cheesy?  I hope not.  The guy who hired me through the website said he liked my music he'd heard but my bio "sucked".. so I thought I should change it.  Thanks a lot!

Hi,

	I'm waiting on the location of the Seattle concert, and so am unsure of my instrumentation as of yet.  Here is what I know for sure:

Bass Clarinet, Piano, Percussion, Bass.  I am bringing in two additional percussionists (one vibraphone), and an alto/bari saxophonist.  If this is in any way "against the rules" please let me know.  Thanks so much!

Hi!  Two questions:

1) Could you re-iterate for me which instruments are available to the seattle-based composers?

2) I will need a conductor.  Is it still going to be Linda?

Thanks.



Yes, it will need a conductor.

Hi again,

	Two questions for ya:

	1) any word on the location of rehearsals and performance?  
	2) I'm trying to plan a vacation around all of this, and wonder about the rehearsals: How will things be scheduled?  Can I expect to have certain rehearsals deal with my piece?  I'd like to be here for those as well as the concert, obviously, so I was sondering if any scheduling had occurred yet.

Thanks so much!

Is something up?  Greg bailed on a rehearsal, so we're short one person next rehearsal, but other than that it's the same as when I last spoke with Jim i.e. this wed. etc; same rehearsal sched. as everyone else. The next two rehearsals will have a bit of extra time alotted to my piece, btw.  I hope that clarifies whatever questions there are.

;)  Hi Wendy,

	I'm one of the finishers at Sunhawk.  Glenda asked me to address your ? about the 'VCFS_42.rms'.  No worries!!  The only thing wrong was Mendellsohn (or however you spell it) had no 'n'.  What a weird file, eh?  That's what was written, though... or put into the edition we scanned!  Let me know of any other questions you may have.

This is low-key and for fun.  If your worried about copyright, maybe it's not for you.  I'm a recorded and published guy, and I think the one other person is as well, so I understand your concern.  However, I think worrying about this will slow/stop the process, since the internet is very much 'on your honor'.

Sounds good.  A tape will go to you after Dave, the other person who is contributing.  After that, it comes back to me, I make copies for everyone, and we start again!

Hey!

	Well, in a sense, yes!  I haven't had the time to pay to a tape yet, and only got my 4track a few weeks ago.  Sorry.  It will come, trust me, but probably not for a month or so.

Thanks,

Nope, spaced the computer..  Soon.  The talking over the internet thing is a mystery to me.  Are you familiar with the search engines around, like hotbot or altavista?  Check it out and try to search for it, there must be something.  Lemme know if you need a hand...

Hey thanks for the newsgroup tip.  Beefheart fans seem to be the mellower of the internet groups: the FZ and Contemporary Classical groups have been really uptight in the past! I totally agree with what you're saying on 345.  The man's whole relaxed approach to his virtuosity is very inspiring.  I find it a bit more expressive than someone who actually WOULD practice microdiddles daily.  !!!!!  :)

pretty cool japanese show and other avantish shows.  Just click on any of those pictures and the shows start, and you can go through the tunes on the show with page up and down keys.  James Wood's show has a lot of electro music that is kind of the predecessor to the music the most csound people do....  Thought you'd wanna check it out.  See ya

Not quite yet...  Did you get the stuff from Home Page Replica?  I actually just picked "Best Batch Yet" and "A Carrot is as close..." up after not having any time to work on them.  It's a lot of work, and with everything I'm doing (I'm a full-time music copyist, as well as a composition student) I don't know when I'll be done.  I will keep your message marked, though, because I'd be anxious for feedback once it's done!  Thanks for the interest... Talk to you soon.

Hi Chris,

	Rehearsal ran a bit late (12!) last night, which explains my absence last evening.  Hope it was a good time.  I'm sorry I couldn't be there, with my Atari 2600, to "stir things up", as the young are so fond of saying.  See ya..

Hi,

	Did you get a chance to look at the build testing script I sent ya?  If you use any particular file to test your code, it'd be helpful to incorporate it into this script.  Also any input you might have would be good.  Thanks.

Ok, I'll quit badgering you with constant little emails.  Here are my questions:

1) What's up with "Formatter cannot format a beam" error message?  Should I send the cases to you where the error comes up, since the formatter should be able to format whatever beam comes up?
	I thought it was a little weird that this error didn't come up in the error check, but when the formatter tried to format!  

2) The error checking strategy is different now, and I'm not sure if I know exactly HOW it's different. 
	As I understand it, the error checker catches everything BUT the formatter related errors (which appear after you attempt to format), so as I see it, there's potential for a crash whenever you try to format an object and aren't yet aware of a formatter-related error.  How can we guard against this potential for crashing within this tiered error-checking scheme?

	I guess I need an answer to this before I can continue testing, so I know what to test for.  I assigned a few bugs to you; could you take a look at 'em?  Thanks.

Hi all,

	I had a similar problem to Kathy's on my mac, and increasing the memory requirement of perf in the Get Info window solved things.  Just an idea..


So my questions are:
	Why is it that pvoc files on different platforms aren't compatible?  I use Unix machines at school, and am trying to use pvoc files I made there on my mac at home.  The mac thinks they're invalid.  Is it a header thing I might change in Soundhack, or (probably) shall I just reanalyze on the mac?
	Does anyone know of a mac Utility which lets you examine the bin values (RK: like pvlook) of pvoc files?  Thanks.

Ok.  So far, there's this beam error..  Once the touchup bug is fixed (4056), I can edit in the build and therefore debug a bit more objectively.  I'll send the test case for that bug also, 4038.rms.  Thanks.

Rainy and gray baby's favorite!  Well, I hope we're still going to Derek's tonight.  He usually calls the night before, to either confirm or cancel, but he didn't last night, so who knows?
Did you listen to art this morning at all? Apparently there was a big green fireball over the Sound last night at 9:30, and even KOMO called Peter Davenport etc etc... I didn't see it though!
Did you sleep good last night??  I missed ya, and had a good night with the music.  I got a thing to play ya sometime.  I talked to my mom and pop last night, and my mom got her job!  She's now assisting special ed teaching, across the hall from Louise, and is really happy.  My dad's really unhappy with his job though, so I feel bad for him.  :(  I told them sat or sun morning we'd do some breakfast.  Is that ok?
I'm stoked for tonight and tomorrow to see ya sweet!  dooka daka..  dooka..  I love ya so.  What's going on at work today?  Maybe you called in sick.. :)

She can give you the details, I didn't quite catch everything because Keisha was going crazy while I talked to her.  She's teaching a bunch of delinquent (SP?)/learning disabled kids a few different subjects.. well, assisting the teacher actually.  She calls it a vacation compared to what she's been doing.  I'm stoked for her.  As far as my dad goes, he just hates the attitudes around boeing and the grind.  I think he's ready to retire, but no where near financially..  :(  He's just really bored I think.

Hi Cam,

	A couple of questions:

1) The error message "Tie isn't linked correctly to other ties/slurs":  Why isn't this taken care of in the error check options selection 'delete objects that are improperly connected'? 

2) Are all the bugs I should check assigned to me in raid?  They all checked out except the ones where a slur crosses a stem when formatting..  not a big deal obviously!  Talk to you soon.

This is fine with one exception: the x notes should play back as "guitar fret noise" since they are, by definition, pitchless articulations.   Thanks!

Of course sweet you can use me to the hilt!  I am yours!  Cough Cough God I don't  feel good BITCH MOAN.  I am a sweaty and tired mess from the golden seal I took last night. I bet I'll be better tonight, and that it's just the golden seal burning me out!  :(  When will you guys be done with the pub quiz?  The rehearsal is probably 2 hours, maybe more.  You'll be here at 5ish, right?  Can you come along on the errands, or do you want me to drop you off at home?

Hi,

	In case you have to make a bass tab staff in a piece, here are the steps involved:

1) Make a tab staff and scale it to 1.5
2) delete the top two staff lines (ctrl+shift to select these)
3) In the tuni's edit box, change the tuni object's octave option two octaves lower ie: the lowest string, e, has an octave of '2'--change this to '0'  The bottom four tuni's pitches are correct (eadg)  See me if ?'s
4) The clef must be moved into place, after scaling to .8, by clicking and holding the mouse button, then holding ctrl.  The clef won't be draggable until you depress ctrl.

Clear?  I hope so.  I'm sick and a little out of it today.  See me if you have questions.

Well, maybe.  I'm still under the gun to get some music done before my next lesson, which I think is next week, but I'm not sure.  We'll see how much I get done this week.  I probably have to take a half day tomorrow, in order to get my finances straightened out..  I thought I heard something about Friday last night, but it's hard to say since I had such a bad headache.  How's it goin?  Get your stuff read for your class, ok?

Hi,

	I know you're very busy getting things together before your trip, but I need to talk to you before you leave, if possible.  The company I work for has offered me a two month position in Russia to train some employees we have there, and I feel like I can't pass it up.  I'm wondering if there's a way I can continue the Tarkovsky study there, as well as possibly earning a lesson credit with you.  I will be writing quite a bit, and will have a roomful of musicians at my disposal, as I'll be teaching them engraving over the two months.  
	If this all sounds alright with you, I can go ahead and register this week, otherwise I'll have to take the quarter off.  I'd appreciate a call if you have time today.  I'll be at work until 6 tonight, at 748-0275.  Thanks.

 So they want me to go because they've got an office there with 70 employees, and all these employees need additional training, AND they need someone to take stock of the sitchyation (an american) and see if those reds are doing what they say they're doing.. That's sort of the unspoken 2nd mission I'm on, I'm beginning to understand.  So we'll see.. I find out more when the honchos sit me down and talk details, which is probably by the end of the week.

Do they need some ace to transcribe all of that high quality

It's derek's house in Ballard.  All his roommates are leaving and the landlord wants someone to sign a year lease... The place has optimum music space in the basement, but I'd rather live with friends than piss off someone for a year with that shit.  It's just off greenwood and 85th in Ballard (well, greenwood I guess) and is pretty plush. It's right across the alley from the Buddhist temple there, which you may know about.  I think with 4 It'd be about $300/month, which is less than I pay now.  
Plus I basically live in bumfuck, so I want to get closer to civilization.  At least walking distance to some stores and such, which this place definitely is.   
Dig?  Cool.  When are we hanging?

Yo yo Rhomboid,

	What's up?  The reason I had to meet with Richard yesterday, and didn't get a chance to tell you about it, is that my work is sending me, all expenses paid, to Russia for two mos!  Can you believe it?
	So, if you could, please tell everyone at comp lab that I'm not going to be there today, since I have to get the ball rolling on this trip with paperwork and a meeting with my boss.  What's going on Sunday?  Do you want to go see a rock show at the croc with a bunch of us?  See ya.  Gonna be in the lab today/tomorrow.

Well yeah.  I'll let you know when I have a bit of free time; I'm pretty busy after work running around preparing for it this week.  I'm leaving in two or three weeks, depending on how fast we get the ball rolling, but it's ASAP as far as they've told me.  The office just switched to a bigger location, so we're all coping with that today.  I'll definitely see/call you soon.  Bye!

Hey,

	It sounds like you're talking about the midi instruments?  For tab staves, assign them all to overdriven or acoustic guitar (whatever the normal staff guitar plays -- either acoustic or overdriven), and for rhythm I match the voice instrument.  None of this actually matters, except for the fact that it looks neater in the viewer.  See ya.

Hey Grady,

No worries on the mix up of tapes.  If you want to trade more, that would be cool, because I've never heard live Garrick stuff except on Weasels... (If that's at the Garrick.. I think it is..)  I sent your tapes out early last week, you should have gotten them already.  I sent them from work, so I'll see if there was a screw-up there.  Thanks again.  Sorry about the lack of track info.  I found the track listing on another Syd site for the syd tape, but didn't get it on the tape when I received it; you'll probably recognize the tunes anyway! :)  
I dig the pirate station bug time.. Listened to it a few times this week.  Would you be interested in playing some stuff of mine?  No pressure.  :)  Take care and talk to you soon.  Re: trading again, I'll be in Russia for two months starting end of oct., so it might not be until later that we can trade.  Take care!

Hi,

	Anyone else have problems using sndwarp on a mac with virtual memory on?  I'm finding that the time point arg works intermittently; it's more likely to work when I ask for a comparison signal in the output, but this doesn't ALWAYS work.  I am using it correctly, as I tried the same code on an SGI/UNIX with great results. 
	Other useful details: I have a ppc with 24m RAM, and add an additional 24m with virt memory.  Also, the sound is a bit big, but not too big: my table size is 262145.  Help?

	There are a few resourses not updated on the web: the latest manual I can find is 3.47, though I know a 3.48 exists online at Univ of Wash.  Also, the "official" csound front page at leeds says 3.46 is the most recent.. etc etc.
	To whom do we address a request that the available information be updated?  The mac ppc port isn't linked on this page, btw.  It seems like getting started with the most recent version of csound would be a bit confusing; everything is a bit decentralized.

He was instructed in this.  It's in the training manual.  Perhaps we should print up another, updated checklist?  I'll do that today.

Hey Lance, long time no talk.  Dig this: I'm headed to Russia for two months, starting next week, so obviously my lag-ass-ness is to be a bit more lag-ass on this album thang.  I've been thinking of it as an open intvite from you guys, is that cool?
	I've got the folks lined up to play, but haven't had time to get a space together, 'cause I've been doing a couple film jobs the past few months, and now this trip!  So, when I get back, I'll get back in touch with you guys, set a release date and get the booking started for shows (Jen Quinn former KCMU Fri. night DJ is going to book).  How about the Deck?  Is it coming together?  I'd like to play a few things before I go and get your opinion.  When's good next week?  Thanks and hope it's going good.

Jeez bad timing I guess..  Give me your # again, home and work, and I'll give you a call.  I'm so busy getting ready -- I may leave in a week!  I'm going to train 70 employees we have there, who do the music editing stuff we do here, only MUCH SLOWER.  Bad work ethic there. So, I'm going to spread cheer!  Work harder comrades!
They're putting me up for two months in Chelyabinsk, which is in the southeastern Ural mountains, relatively low elevation.  Work is paying for the whole thing.  So that's the where why and how.
Omar is pretty egotistical on stage, you might barf.  Talk to you soon, k?

Hey,

nobody told you yesterday, and that may have been my fault, but Feedback Fri is going to be on the 21st this time (or 22 or whatever.. week after the 16th).  This is because the lunchroom hasn't yet been outfitted and stuff, so Mary didn't think we'd be ready for it this Friday, k?  Lunch today or what?

Hi Tarkovsky folks,

	I haven't posted in awhile, hope all is well with everyone.  The company I work for is sending me to Russia (Chelyabinsk, specifically) for two months, where I will continue my Tarkovsky independent study, among other things.  I'm due to leave next week, and am therefore now, temporarily, unsubscribe to the list.  With a little luck, I may be able to figure it out without swearing at everybody!
	You have all been very helpful in my research.  Though the paper was in mid-stages, those of you who took the time to read and feedback to me were kind indeed.  Thanks, and soon there will be a bit more 'academic', longer version complete.
	As a semi-final request, is anyone on the list able to direct me towards people/places that may offer an extra, added insight to Tark?  I will simply start quizzing everyone I meet there unless I have a bit of direction, which I was hoping to glean from the list.  
	Please drop me a line, off the list, if you can point me in any right direction.  Thanks so much for everything!

Hi,

	I've gotten a couple of reports that one of our new hires is prone to rifling through the hotbox for the easy pieces, and as far as I know one person (Heather) has already talked to one of you. 
	I just wanted to confirm that someone's talked to one of you, because everyone seems to be aware of the problem now, and is asking me about it!  Word travels fast.  Reclarify over email the hotbox 'rules'?

	After your work is fine.  The new address is 223 Taylor.  You go up denny towards seattle center, but turn right on taylor, where dv8/teamsters are.  It's one block down from denny, on your left at this point, and on the same block as McDonald's. It's a grey building with lotsa windows.  Pull up and come to the second floor; if the front door's locked start honkin!  Love ya!

Aha.  I guess this came to me because I'm the only one with time to kill finding these! (On company time, of course!)

Csound Manual:
ftp://ftp.musique.umontreal.ca/pub/CsoundManual/
..purportedly contains v3.48b1   As a side note, there is little or no addition between these manuals, except for some physical modelling stuff (I think).  As far as I know, if the version you download contains man pages for locsig, locsend, space, and pvadd, you have the most recent as it is.

Common Music:

ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/Lisp/cm/binaries/cm-ppc.sea.bin

This one's harder to find. You may or may not know this, but 'sources' refers to actual text files, full of code, while 'binaries' are already compiled and actually executable.  In the future, you don't want to hang your modem up for an hour downloading a source pack, unless you REALLY want to compile it! 

Hope this all helps.  You'll need stuffit or something that'll decode binhex for the cm.  Talk to you soon.

Linda and Don:  Copied for your pleasure..

Hi,

	BBedit.  If you get common music as referred to in the last email, you may want to use the editor in the common music program.  It highlights parenthesis constantly, while BBEdit only does when they're first entered.  This will make sense later if it doesn't already!

Hi all,

	Abe was unlucky enough to grab the first 7-string guitar tab piece from the pile!  For your reference, attached is a word file explaining how to add a staff line to a tab staff, and tune it to low B.  
	IF you have a different pitch for the low string, ask craig, pete, or I for help!  This is pretty unlikely, but I never thought the 7-string would show up either.   Weeedly-weeedly weeee!  (burnin fast guitar licks)

No free lisp, actually.  CCRMA posts binaries now.  There's a team from Mills, I think, updating the ppc version (Mac) to keep it up to date, so the Mac versions SHOULD be current from here on out..

Hi Funk,

	I wasn't sure who to send this to, or to log it, but when a customer previews 1984 by Van Halen, they get the WHOLE SONG (1 page!).. Thought you might want to know.

Hi,

	When I play this 1984 by Van Halen, I get the dialog saying "You are entitled to play this selection once.", while the license agreement only mentions printing it once.  Is this correct?

Hi,

	I'd suggest the song of the week page have a visual element besides the 'song of the week' icon.  Scanned graphics/in house graphics or somethin...  Today on a Joplin piece there was only text, when we have all that joplin stuff to draw from.

See ya!!  Get better, I might be leaving soon.  I got my passport over the weekend!

Sweet I love you too!!  I'm going to miss you soooo bad!  I have all my paperwork now, so it looks like this week/weekend!  I'm really surprised it went so fast.  I'm getting the full flight options today; it still looks vaguely possible to go to bali, though that may mean I take the sketchy Russian Aeroflot instead of a comfy US airline..  I'm still tempted though.  Loves let me know what you think!

Father Comrade:

Email's staying the same actually.  No need for the shots, actually.  Tuesday probably, since I may actually be going thursday.  When is everyone home?  Lemm e know. Lunch is great, name the day.  I'll call ya tonight.  All paperwork for the trip, besides visa, was done when I got here, accompanied by one higher-up saying "when can you leave?"  Scary!

Yep it came over the weekend actually. I know, we WILL go to bali eventually.  I'm probably going to have the travel bug so bad, I'll want to go this summer again no matter what!  And, I really am going to be missing you at christmas so the sooner i see you, the better.  Since I'm going thursday at the earliest, I should go see the parents tomorrow, so I don't know if I can make the pub quiz.  I want you to come with, but I understand if you can't. :'((((  I'm sad now.  Can't wait to see you tonight!  Can we stay at my house tonight?  I'll drive you to and pick you up from work tomorrow, k?  I love you so much sweet.  Songs galore.

Well, they want me to come over Wed. now because Andy can't go tomorrow.   Can you come after you're class?  I love you so.  Goodbye party Thursday?  I'm leaving in about an hour for Old Navy, then going to food, then going home.  See you there?  I hope you did good on your quiz sweet.  I miss you.

1) Note linkage dialog doesn't automatically come up after hitting first syllable of lyric line.  Lyric wizard acts a little strange in some cases due to this.

2) The stem angle formatting isn't working.

..That's all so far.. The lyric thing sure is weird, but I think we can handle it.  I didn't get into raid yet, I'll do that tomorrow.  Can we meet 2-3pm tomorrow to discuss results?  Looks pretty good so far..

Ummm...  John Joy Scott Matt (I called him)..  um.. Boy that's all I can think of ..  Andy's comin...  We're going out to the 'rents tomorrow, so we can't go to pub quiz I guess.  I was planning on it, I'm not busy.  I'm leaving here in an hour ot do a bit of shoppin, then I'll see ya at the Cedar's, so it works out good.  A bit earlier would work better, like 6 or 6:30, is that too early?
