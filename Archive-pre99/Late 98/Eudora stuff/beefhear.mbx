Usually tape trades run 2 for 1, but alot of people on the list don't trade.  Here are the options:

1) 2 blanks (90min. high bias)

2) 1 boot (send me your list, I'll send you mine if you like)

Thanks!

Etiquette states two boots trade for one boot, but I'd settle for one.  If you don't have a boot to trade, sending me a 90 min. high bias cassette with nothing on it is ok too.  :)  I had to strike a deal to become a branch of this 'tree', (my first time doing this sort of thing), and was hoping to built the collection up a bit through this, but like I said: if you don't have boots to trade a blank is fine!

Thanks for your organization.  I'm tracking down the serious music (I'm getting a friend to clean it up and press a cd-- sshhhhhh!! :) , and it looks like I'll get ahold of it this weekend.  I'm definitely still gung ho on this!  I have a couple ?s:

1) What's etiquette here? Same 2for1 trading I've read on other websites, or is this a service?  I haven't gotten any mail from anyone who wants to trade, yet..  

2) Do you mind trusting me (!) and sending the tape so I can get started on the leaves?  I won't get a tape in the mail to you until Monday, so It'll be a bit.  If you want to wait, I totally understand.

Hi again,

Well, this is the Tape Tree I've come up with. Unfortunately not enough
people contacted me in time, so of the 5 Branch Leaders who expressed
interest in copying  tapes for 5 leaves, 3 of those Branch Leaders will have
only 4 leaves to make copies for. Perhaps those who want a tape could
contact one of these people who have only 4 names assigned to them and
request a tape. But ya better hurry!

The tape that I'm sending out is the ENTIRE phone interview done on the
Dutch Radio show "Supplement" which was broadcast 7/27/98. The original
broadcast contained lots of Dutch language commentary and album cuts, as
well as snippets of older interviews and a chunk of a 1980 concert in
Amsterdam. They also played the entire Lick My Decals Off, Baby album. The
real attraction here was a 1993 phone interview with Don conducted by one of
the Dutch gentlemen who created this broadcast. The broadcast did not play
the entire phone conversation.

The tape I am sending out contains the entire phone conversation conducted
that day. Originally, when I started this tape tree, I was offering an
edited version of the original 4 hour broadcast which contained some of the
music that was played, the pieces of the 1993 phone interview and some
concert material and at the end I tacked on the 6 "Stand Up And Be
Discontinued" poems, for a grand total of 90 minutes.

So, as you can see, this new tape is way better and a whole lot rarer.

All of you Branch Leaders please e-mail me with your addresses and final
confirmation of your willingness to copy this tape for your leaves.

I'll have this tape out to you in 3 days.

Leaves, it's up to you to contact your Branch Leader and set up whatever
deal you want to. You, of course are free to make copies for anyone you wish
once you recieve yours. The quality ought to be pretty clean still.

In the future, if enough interest is there, I will Tree out a copy of the 6
poems and other points of interest (older interview snippets, concert
material) from the show which did not fit on this tape.

And now, the Tree Structure:


Branch Leader #1
Cormac O'Donahue @ cormac49@hotmail.com

Hi Ben,

My favorite Beef boot is entitled Best Batch yet.  It has not only the last
live gig, but also some unreleased studio tracks.  I don't know if it's
"percussion-heavy", though.  What's your definition or example of that?

The Syd Barrett boots-(Pink Floyd) Steel Breeze and Magnesium Proverbs are
excellent.  I'm sure we can work something out.

Later dude,

George

I'll tape up the Beefheart for you for the Dutch show you'll get.  If you want
to trade the San Fran Devo show for a Syd Barrett tape, let me know.

Perhaps. None of it was bull's eye as far as I'm concerned, but perhaps
some is of interest to ther traders. I'll send you a couple of tapes with
som '80's stuff on anyway. For the time being, just send me the tape with
the program in return. I'll get bach with more if I want to trade further. OK?

h e y    n o w . . . .
is it really necessary to toss about derogatory terms like "scholar"?

In dem lyrics....(the shiniest beast in his 3 pronged aural pitchfork
of woids, vox, moosik)..."Captain Beefheart" used random scatter gun
verbiage, wayward (secret) non sequiturs, renegade unfinished
(unvarnished) images, placenta mush wordscapes n' jungle gym word play
just as Chagall or Miro or Van Gogh or Klimt or VLIET used splashes &
sweeps of paint on drum tight canvases.  The deep nature lullabyes he
recited were only as RANDOM as the crispy burnt n' dusty moth wings
that wait in yer ceiling lamp fixture at this moment....Only as GENIUS
as the fine pink rodent lungs that quiver & weeze `neath yer floor
boards & stars.  Such was the "everything at once always" quantum
puree of Don's words.  Whether induced by LSD, warm wet flesh,
traumatic toilet training, or simply a couple of nostrils filled with
early evenin' desert air, his lyrics were/are (to me) like a "trail
mix" of invisible truth pirhanna making happy love to that soft cosmic
bullseye.

As profound as the sweet grunt of a mama hippopotamus.
As perfect as a clump of housefly eggs.

Attempting to interpret or dissect Don's lyrics is a bent Greyhound
bus ride in the wrong direction....it's like looking for meaning in
the exquisite shape & color of a grizzly bear's fresh bowel movement.
Dig?

this moment, da Captain ain't rankin' in the top 10 vote getters (Herb
Alpert either)....so wriggle on over to www.wallofsound.com

eligible.

are not ..i'm sure we all know some]buy the beefbox the same week maybe it
could chart. not important i know but satisfying to see the captain getting
some recognition.

re: "Safe as Milk"= acid epiphany.

I heard/read somewhere at sometime that it referred to a milk contamination
scare in the 60's. "Safe as milk" was a common phrase at the time rendered
ironic by the scare. I don't doubt the hallucinogenic aspect of the lyrics,
but I believe this is yet another layer to the song and album title.
Anybody got more info on this?

I've been downloading the "Another Chapter in the Lives and Times of Capt.
Beefheart" boot from Filtered through Dust Speakers, and was wondering
about the Brown Star sessions. I have never heard of Brown Star anywhere
else and would like any info on it. Some of the songs are very good and I
like that Don plays so much harp on them- he is really a good player. I
though it was interesting that there are recordings of "Dirty Blue Gene"
and "Best Batch Yet" purported to be from '70 ('71?). I always assumed Best
Batch was about the latter Magic Band. What's the scoop? Is this just run
of the mill bootleg huxterism? Was an album scuttled back then?

thanks,


scott

This is part of a message I sent to an individual on the list.  I thought
I'd share it with the whole list.  I'm not sure how much of it everyone
already knows...

--------------------------------

Yes, as you may know Don is very sick too.  That is why I and others who
know him* speculate he stopped making music altogether, he couldn't sing
porperly anymore :(  You might have noticed the difficulty he had
articulating at times on the Dutch interview.  That's not his
eccentricity.

* (The grammar here makes it seem as though I actaully know Don; that
isn't so)

Richard "Midnight Hatsize" Snyder is in a band called the Mystery Band
with Ace (I forget his last name) who was a longtime friend of Don's
(still is?).  I met him once briefly and we talked about the above illness
and Don's art.

Midnight Hatsize also appeared on a tape (and later CD) by Ant Bee.
Anyone heard it?  Not bad.

Take care,

Sam

Hello all,

I'm new to the list so I thought I'd start with a quick introduction and
then hit you all with some questions.

I've been a Beefheart fan for over 6 years now.  It was Trout Mask that I
bought at one of my favorite record shops in Southern California
(incedentially, I found out years later that the man I bought it from, one
of the shop's co-owners, is none other than Richard "Midnight Hatsize"
Snyder !! But that's another story all together).  I listened to it with
complete disgust unequalled by a first-listen (maybe Lou Reed's Metal
Machine Music outdid it, but that one I couldn't sit through all the way,
I gave Trout Mask the whole chance).  But I was drawn back to it
continually with what I thought was some kind of masochism.  Well, after
about 20 listens I was hooked and bought everything I could find.

Trout Mask still has a special place in my heart for that reason, but I
might venture to say that Lick My Decals Off and Shiny Beast equal, if not
surpass, it in listening pleasure.

I don't like the Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot albums as much as the others and
I don't think I've really even listened to Unconditionally Guaranteed all
the way through (Bluejeans and Moonbeams I don't own and have never heard
- don't care to either).  

My first bootleg was a CD called "London 1974" which is horrible!  While
in Dresden, Germany I found a CD of "Don's Birthday Party" and "Live at My
Father's Place," both of which are amazing!

Because I have a friend in Holland, I got a tape of the Dutch interview
almost right after it was broadcast (and my friend translated the Dutch
parts for me!).  He also dubbed me a concert given in Amsterdam (Nov. 80)
as well as a show from manchester (April 72).  Besides the Zappa stuff on
Lost Episodes, I have a tape of an early Zappa/Beefheart song "I was a
teenage malt shop."

So my question to everyone is:  what am I missing that is REALLY
essential?  My computer sucks so I can't get the goodies from the website.
How could I get those rarities (especially the original Bat Chain Puller
and Trout Mask outtakes/rehearsals) w/out being able to download them?
Anyone want to swop or dub them for me?

And for those who didn't notice:  the most recent Wire magazine has a list
of the "100 Records That Set the World on Fire...while no one was
listening."  It's an amazing list of some really great records and
Beefheart's original Bat Chain Puller is, ironically (since it's never
been released), on it.

Hope to hear from some and will enjoy being on the list.

Take care,

Sam Frederick

O Solo Drumbo is a fabulous CD. Especially "Three For 5" (in which he
plays, polyrhthmically, in 3/8, 4/4 and 5/4 all at the same time. Listen
to the hi-hat. That is wicked.) People should buy it. Cecil Taylor said
that the piano was just 101 tuned drums, and that makes all drumming
music by definition.
	Go listen to it. 345.

I gather, from some of the responses to one of my posts, that I gave
the impression that I found the live performances lacking in some way in
comparison to the records.
	That was not my intent at all. I saw the Bat Chain Puller line-up and
was completely floored by the performance. I also saw a concert in the
UG (Unconditionally Guaranteed) tour, and although much is made of how
bad that band was, especially in comparison to the other incarnations of
the MB, I found that they did justice to the material, at least in most
cases. Van Vliet made the best of a less-than-ideal situation, and was
obviously having a hell of a lot of fun doing it, despite the occasional
heckling by ill-mannered jerks. His personal charisma in both
performances was incredible. Larger than life.
	The Bat Chain Puller band (Williams, Tepper, Feldman, Walley) was as
good as it gets performance-wise. Don't take this as a putdown of the
TMR band or any other, I'm just saying in a positive non-comparative way
that the BCP band was amazing. Beefheart is an incredibly warm stage
personality with a talent for relating to members of the audience as
individuals. The constant interaction. He was chiding one guy for
looking at his watch during a song, as if there was somewhere else the
guy would rather be. To one guy who was out of control he said his
classic line, "Someone's had too much to think." That was before Doc
came out.
	All I was trying to say is that in the world of live performances, if
you didn't see CB and the MB live then yes, you missed out big time. But
at the same time, you know you're a man. Sorry. I mean at the same time
it has to be remembered that the instrumental parts are all worked out
and rehearsed, and not that much different from the albums. It's not
like seeing a blues band on a Saturday night and comparing it to an
album recorded at 8:00 on a Tuesday morning one track at a time under
fluorescent lights. As Jimmy Carl Black said, TMR was like a live album
that happened to be recorded in a studio.
	I think that one of the things that makes Beefheart so very special to
his fans, or to most of us, is the almost supernatural way everything
fits together, and the way the lyrical images seem to come alive and
make you say, "Oh yah, I see what he means," even though trying to
remember it later is like remembering a dream...so clear at the time but
so hard to get a handle on after the fact. Think of the way the guitars
come in during Glider (on Spotlight Kid) after he says that the sun
shows through, and right on cue, there's a shadow beside her. They just
sound like the sun breaking through the clouds, and of course that whole
yin-yang light-dark sort of imagery about the shadows appearing as soon
as the sun comes out says so much about the nature of existence
itself...the whole way that comes together is just perfect. Genuinely
inspired.
	His compositional genius, the lyrical magic, the mysterious perfection
in the midst of seeming roughness, the deft mix of the humorous and the
dead-serious, all of that stuff that my lame adjectives can't do justice
to, all of that is right there on the albums. So the people who never
saw them live should know that while they  missed out on some great live
performances (and geez I wish I could have seen more of them), I firmly
believe that the "magic" of Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band is
right there on the albums, and all it takes is a CD player and set of
headphones and some free time.

Some posters recently suggested that they had lost out in some way by
not seeing a live show. While it is true that there is something extra
magical about seeing the Magic Band live, Captain Beefheart nevertheless
completely nails it on the albums. There is no special extra that comes
from a live performance other than the incredible immediacy of it and
the realization that this isn't Plato, it's actual human beings. Setting
an evening aside with the headphones and a couple of Beefheart CDs is
going to get you as close as the next person, regardless of who saw what
live band when.

Howdy!

I'm an olde fart that's new to the list, and here is recommended
introductory material.

I am a career state employee  - -  Louisiana Highway Dept worker, currently
living in the country north of Baton Rouge where I raise goats and
caterpillars (specifically, catalpa worms - - for fishbait, not human
consumption!).  When I grow up and out of being a wage slave (in 8 years I
retire) I will move to the mountains or desert of West Texas or New Mexico,
my favorite part of the world.

I had to buy Trout Mask when I first saw it in Bert's Camera and Record
Store back in 1970(I think) because the the cover - - the man holding the
Carp head in front of his face with the hat made me laugh.  The music seemed
to strike some kind of resonance that I couldn't and still can't explain - -
it made perfect sense to me in a way that echoed back to earliest childhood
feelings and memories. Compared to other stuff I was listening to at the
time, troutmaskreplica stood out like a triceratops in a herd of cattle.

Music like the slide of Muddy Waters, the mighty Wolf, the country blues of
Memphis Minnie, the sound of South Indian music, the guitar sounds of Keith
Richards, Rbt Johnson, and Phil Manzanera, Iggy and the Stooges, Tibetan and
Tuvan throat singing, and the Magic Band have remained a valued part of my
life thru marriage, divorce, times of living out of my car and times of
prosperity.

Of Beefheart's stuff I like TMR, Decals, Sptlite Kid and Clear Spot best. 

Since picking up on the Captain, I have only known a dozen guys (no gals)
that liked, or even could tolerate for more than 15 seconds  the music on
TMR.  Its odd that the few see these notes and drumbeats as "making sense"
in the deepest sort of way, while the vast army of pink normals see this
stuff as weird, acid induced noise - - the most unlistenable racket on vinyl.
Maybe Phillip K. Dick's concept of a "plasmate"-- the view of a social urge,
like a religion, or a particular aesthetic force  as a living entity that is
sustained by its believers or patrons could apply to Beefheart's soul music.
If  music has soul, then it must be alive, right? Because of all its horns
and appendages, this crustacean is easy to spot from a long ways away.  It
moves pretty fast, too. Especially across the tundra or alkali flats.

Anyway, enough of this, and back to work and attending another safety meeting.

Glad this list exists,

Anybody know specifics about the Doc At The Radar Station tour in 1980?  
I'm looking for the dates and locations.  This is for John French, 
actually.

Remember, the upcoming Revenant release is going to have enhanced CDs.  
That may well mean a sample of some of the video material out there, in 
(relatively) clean format.  Or it may not - I don't know what exactly will 
be on them.

>btw, the Brown Star is the Earth.

It's in the treasure box sitting with Graham now, but I remember reading a 
poem he wrote that was something like 6 lines, which was included with him 
talking about "Brown Star" - it may have been in one of those Warner 
"Circular" magazines or whatever those square promo mags were.

The poem had something like:

I know a special star
That very few have found
they're always looking up 
when they should be looking down
... and so on.

AFAIK, "Brown Star" was an early name for what became "Clear Spot".  
"Brown Star" was, rather unappealingly, an ass reference.  CB even had a 
poem to go with it.

If it's in with a hardcover and 5 CDs...  it won't be cheap.  Certainly 
worth it, though.

I would hazard a guess that some Bat Chain Puller material would be on the 
discs; it leaked out in various versions here and there, so there's 
probably recordings of it that, while they may or may not match the 
"original bat chain puller", may be close.

I'm excited to hear the "leftovers" - there's probably stuff I haven't 
heard in there, and it's been some years since I heard a really new CB 
song, so to speak.  (There's only so many boots/unreleased material out 
there...)

Just to let you know i'd be very willing to contribute to the tape tree. 

I'm not sure if my corrospndance address is available to you though, I'd 
appreciate it if someone could tell me if I'd have to send my address 
out to someone.

While i'm here, one curious thing which has struck me about Beefheart is 
how much he seemed to age between 1973 and 1982. Does anyone else think 
this or is it just me?

Beefheart fans everywhere. In honor of the impending 1st of August, I 
offer you this rather incorrect haiku:


Too many tubs of slaw. I don't know where we're going to put them.

To many tubs of slaw: I offer you my greetings.

Two many tubs of slaw. Your limit's ten on this aisle and don't even 
think about writing a check.


I guess the irony here is who is going to want 1 tub of slaw, let alone 
12.


                                          JMT.

Hello,

First comment. I have noticed many people are repulsed at their first 
listen to Beefheart. that seems weird for me, because I was instantly 
attracted to the music, and loved it since the first listen. I guesse 
I'm just weird (of course I had Edgar Varesse, Primus, and numerous 
others in my collection before, so maybe I was just prepared)

Anyone who is interested in "I was a teenage Malt shop" should know that 
the Frank Zappa "mystery Discs" are being rerealesed (on one cd) and 
include old tracks (probably with beefheart) including I believe "Metal 
has won his wings"

yours, Jason

Brizz you were right on the mark, the only way anything can be 
interesting is if there are different oppinions on it! If we all felt 
that Don's music represented the same thing we would all have very 
little to read. I think this is one of the most interesting lists I have 
encountered, it has people from all sorts of different ways. From the 
scholars to the goofballs. 

Well that's my bit. Hail Eris! Oi! Goodbye.

I have a few comments on David's comments.
Random was just the word that I used to describe his writing, because 
that's how I describe what I write when it's automatic writing. It just 
seems to fit best of anything I can think of.

David mentioned that Don was 30 or 40 years to late for Dada, but I 
think the world needs dadaists now more then ever. I think that 
something needs to be shaken up, so I don't feel he was too late. 

well I'll take my leave now. Goodbye, and hail Eris.

       -Jason

There has been a little dispute over Don's lyrics. Some are saying that 
there is a lot of randomness, some say it's all purposeful. I for one 
think  a lot is random. I feel Don understood the power of randomness. 
When he added a phrase of no meaning he allowed people to find their own 
conclusion, make there own art out of his art, if you understand me. 
Thank you for your time.

Hello, 
I'd be very interested in getting the edited version since I know no 
dutch whatso ever. So if you do edit it down I'd be interested in it. I 
have a number of Beefheart boots that I could send in return.

Hello all, my name is Gavin. I am currently writing my dissertation on
Don Van Vliet for my Fine-Art degree at KIAD art college in
Canterbury, Kent, England. By  concentrating on both his painting and
music and using theories of psuedonms and Naivety (and others) to help
discuss his work, I am attempting to open his work up to a wider
appreciation, and demonstrating the importance Van Vliet's works in
the everyday as well as in the arts. As well as showing my own
personal appreciation. 
I have found the internet a useful resource in my investigations of
Van Vliet's work, and hope that this site will also be beneficial to
my research. And may even prompt others to follow in a similar
direction, unless others know of papers already written on Van Vliet
(if so I would definatly like to know, as it would be very useful to
me). I hope to keep you posted on how my work is going by inserting
some of my dissertation on this site, if anyones is interested that
is. Well, thanks for reading this, I hope to send more info. on my
progress, bye for now Gavin. 
p.s. sorry about the spellings, still haven't gotten used to this damn
machine, and can't spell too well!

--  Cripes, a number of aussies have mailed me ,  I can't believe there are so many on
this list.
Proportionally the numbers are vast given there are only 70 odd  members. I'm on  a number
of other lists with hundreds of members and the aussies are very few.
Regarding seeing the Cap'n live as opposed to the Cd's, I have to agree that live was the
best experience, if only because of the tremendous personalities of the various magic band
members,the whole band oozed charisma and the cap'n especially. I also agree that theJeff
Morris Tepper band kicked ass,     I  thoroughly enjoyed the 1980 show I saw at
loughborough, tremendous playing,.
Don was a wonderful performer,  I just wish therewas some better quality video out there
of some of the shows. What i have is very spotty, none of it excellent apart from the BBC
doc.Are there excellent copies of this stuff in circulation ?
Bickershaw WAS filmed, there were projection screens and apparently therewas a special of
the festival on Tyne tees tv, which i never saw, but a friend did a few months after the
festival.Is there beef footage languishing in some vault somewhere, very likely.
if only we knew for sure......

G'Day Folks,
                   Greetings from far flung Australia. I'd like to introduce myself, Dave
Lang is my moniker and I've been a Beef fan since around 1970. I was lucky enough  to see
the magic band four times in all. Twice in 1972  once in 73 and yet again in 1980.Each of
these concerts I rank amongst the best I have ever seen. The power and stage presence of
the good Cap'n was awesome, his musicians were astounding and the music was just out of
this world.
        I've only just discovered this list , in fact I haven't even lurked , as I
normally do before posting. but I only discovered this week that there is a recording of
the 1973 Beefheart concert I attended at Leicester University.  I would dearly love to
hear this again. If anyone has a recording of this could they send me a private e-mail, I
have lots of live music to trade  .
I'm in the process of constructing a humble webpage about the Captain with reviews of two
of the shows I attended, Bickershaw and Leicester Uni 73, which is  another reason I'd
like to hear this show again, just to boost the old memory banks.
.
dave

Overstated on my part no doubt, but I was thinking of "Hobo Chang Ba" at
that moment: let's call the lyrics "oblique" shall we?

I forgot to mention in my initial introductory post a funny CB incident. I
was at this stuffy English school and members of my class were supposed to
bring in topical news cuttings or give short poetry readings, to start the
day with intellectual discussion (in what would be called the 'homeroom' in
the States.) On my 18th birthday, my friend Alan and I opted to give a
reading. We stood up on the teachers desk and held forth, a unison duet of
"Orange Claw Hammer" recited from memory, complete with body gestures
acting out the lyric and the glitch on "lic..licorice twisted around under
a fly..."
	I don't remember any converts but we thought we were hilarious.

Hi folks,
	First posting here to the newly discovered list. Wonderful that the
net has allowed the fringes to reach each other-Captain Beefheart is
usually a conversational dead end in normal life.
	I'm Dave Blackburn, musician, composer, producer, recording
engineer, currently dwelling in Fallbrook, California, contemplating moving
to Copenhagen next year (for reasons too numerous to go into here), 39 yrs
old. I grew up in England and was introduced to CB at age 11 when I heard
Hot Rats. But  the gravelly voice on Willie the Pimp in itself didn't get
me. Later, about age 15, I heard some of the older kids at boarding school
(hi Colin Todd if you're on this list) going around saying "fast and
bulbous" and "a squid eating dough in a polyethylene bag..." to each other.
Naturally I had to belong to this club. My musical tastes already included
Henry Cow, Magma, Mahavishnu, Gong, and Hatfield. Musical complexity was
what I thrived on, and difficult-to-get-into music was my thing. I was
starting to play drums and liked challenging polyrhythms, dissonant
harmonies, and what I've heard aptly described as "rehearsal intensive
music." Obviously I was ripe for Trout Mask. I liked the mystique: the back
photo, the stage names, the nonsense lyrics, the anarchic sound within an
unfathomable structure. I thought, imagine having a blank roll of tape and
recording something like this onto it; imagine a record company releasing
this (they wouldn't nowadays); the aesthetic was really what drew me
in-about as un-English as it could be, seemingly, and yet here were these
English prog-rock  bands like Henry Cow combining  free jazz with densley
structured compostions with loony titles like Nirvana for Mice (very
Beefheart). I felt a funny kinship.
	I listened to it over and over, and subsequently The Spotlight Kid,
Clear Spot and Lick my Decals Off. CB was one of my social testers: if you
could dig him, we could talk. Girlfriends were exempt from the test, as I'd
be asking for the brush ( I once tried out Mahavishnu's Birds of Fire on my
first girlfriend, and got the point fast)
	Summer,1974, Oxford New Theatre. I went with my dad to hear
Beefheart, with Henry Cow opening for him. I bootlegged the show on my
cassette recorder tucked under my greatcoat. Unfortunately it was the
Unconditionally Guaranteed tour, not the real Magic Band, and  certainly
not the real Beefheart music. Apart from the pleasure of seeing him in
itself, the music was crap (Henry Cow on the other hand were brilliant.)
	The bluesier jamming Beefheart (Mirror Man, Strictly Personal)
doesn't do much for me. But when Shiny Beast and Doc at the Radar Station
came out we were back with a vengeance. Even my girlfriend at college liked
"Tropical Hot Dog Night." It was a staple of bong and mushroom parties.
1980, right before I left England for the States, I got to hear the Doc
tour at Birmingham. Incredible. An all new band, still kids when Trout Mask
came out, playing the Trout Mask stuff note for note, proving that these
were arrangements instead of random cacophony. Ice Cream for Crow contains
some nice moments (the very Trout Mask "Hey Garland I dig your tweed coat")
but seemed a bit like an assortment of short tracks instead of an album.
	The one and only Andy Partridge of XTC has said that Trout Mask and
Shiny Beast are his favorite albums, which speaks well of him. He has even
shown some direct influence in his own work: Roads Girdle the Globe, from
Drums and Wires, features a decidedly Hobo Chang Ba vocal, and there is an
XTC cover of Ella Guru, no doubt listed in the "Radar Station" archive.
	Talk to you soon.............. Dave

http://blueflamecafe.Son_House.html                                                                                                                                    
I think some beefheart fans will like it

Having recently listened to the Beefheart interview tape, and
determining that Don was living in Trinidad, CA at the time of the
interview, it reminded me of the last opportunity I had to see Don "in
person"...I was living in Eureka, CA (south of Trinidad) in 1976, going
to Humboldt State University,  and happened into the local health food
store.  While I contemplated the various notions and potions, in walks
the Captain, who was "rumored" to be living up in Trinidad.  Having
spent some time up Trinidad way, I can understand why Don chose to live
there; great views and solitude among the redwoods.

Hi all,

	To my 'leaves':  Sorry if there's been a delay with your tapes.  My tape
deck decided to die (actually, slow down to 3/4 orig. speed!  and no speed
adjust inside!) last week, as luck would have it.  I borrowed a replacement
from a kind friend last night, so if you haven't received anything yet,
it's on the way.

	To everyone else:  Let's exchange trade lists.  Most of my 'leaves' didn't
have lists goin, so I have alot of blanks now!  

Thanks,

Ben

Hey, now!!

By now all branches have recieved thier tapes of the Beefheart / Cor de
Kloet telephone interview broadcast on the fine Dutch radio show
"Supplement" in July. Actually, re-broadcast, as I'm told.

Anyway, all you leaves out there, if you haven't already done so, contact
your branch leaders and get your copy  as soon as possible! It really is a
good one.

Thanks to those branch leaders to whom I sent tapes. Troutmask sent me a
nice 90 minute Beefheart show that I'd never heard before, in return. Ken
Hutchinson has offered me an old Beefheart poster in exchange for my tape.
Ben McCallister has some "Serious Music" coming my way. Haven't heard from
Bill Dougan yet. Cormac is out there getting copies ready for his leaves.

Hopefully you all will enrich your collections trading these tapes.

Share the music!!

Bill

Hey, all

As you know, I decided to set up a "tape tree" in order to get the recent
(7/27/98) Dutch Radio 4 broadcast about the career and music of Captain
Beefheart out to as many members as were interested. I have found 5 members
who are willing to be "branches" and they know who they are. I am in process
of assigning to those branches the names of "leaves", members who would like
a tape of the show and who will then contact the branch to whom they are
assigned and make some sort of deal with that branch to obtain a tape copy
of the show.

In other words, I make 5 copies, send them out to 5 people who in turn make
5 copies each and send them out, and so on.

So far, the response from prospective leaves has been less than
overwhelming, but I thought maybe I'd give it a few more days. I expect to
receive, within a week or so, an improved sound quality copy of the show
from another source. As you may remember, I mentioned that the tape I have
suffers a bit from radio interference and other gremlins, such as
bleed-through from some music that had been previously recorded on the
master tape. (The guy I got it from used a CSN&Y bootleg tape in lieu of a
fresh tape for one of the 3 tapes that comprise the show in its entirety).
The new tape I'm expecting suffers from none of these anomalies, so if you
all can wait a few more days, maybe I can get a few more people interested
in a copy, and a much better sounding one at that.

By the way, the tape I'm sending out is a 90 minute Maxell XLII cassette
tape. I will edit out all of the Dutch language narration and keep the
Beefheart interviews, select tunes and live material intact. Also, at the
end of the tape I'm tacking on the 6 poems that Beefheart recorded in 1993
for the "Stand Up And Be Discontinued" book. (They appear on a 3" CD that
came with the book). Sadly, it appears that these 6 recordings may just be
the last recordings that Don will ever do......from all accounts, Don has a
very serious illness which has robbed him of his abilities, certainly his mu
sic, and very probably his painting.

A listen to those 6 poems should be enough to convince you.

OK, let me know if you want to be a leaf for this tape. Those who have
already responded need not do so again, I have your e-addresses and we'll
make sure that you get a tape.

Thanks, friends

Bill

Howdy,

Well, I have my 5 branches. Now we need leaves. If you are interested in
being a leaf in this tape tree, please e-mail me and I will assign your name
to a branch leader, who has agreed to make at least 5 tape copies for
interested parties.

Please get in touch with me by 12:00 pm, Wednesday, Aug 19.

Hello, all!

OK, I've edited the 4 hour Beefheart Dutch radio broadcast down to 90
minutes. I think it came out pretty good, too. At the end of the tape I
added the 6 poems that Beefheart recorded in 1993, and which may prove to be
the last recordings he will ever make. I left some of the songs in because
of the way that they were segued in with interviews and things. I think
you'll enjoy it.

So here's the deal: I will make 5 copies of this tape and I'll take the
first 5 people who respond to this message. The stipulation is that you, in
turn, must make 5 copies of your tape for 5 other people who want one.
Therefore, when I receive your message that you are interested in recieving
a copy of this tape and that you are willing to make tape copies for at
least 5 others, I will post your name and assign to you the names of 5 other
people who want this tape. You work it out between you (the "branch") and
the 5 others who want a tape (the "leaves") as to how to you want to take
care of such things as postage, blanks, trades, etc.

The idea here is to get it out to as many interested fans as possible with
as little generation loss as possible. I understand that there are around 60
members of the FireParty list, and this should take care of just about all
of 'em, give or take.

For my part, the first 5 people who e-mail me will please include a trade
list from which I may select a tape in trade. If no list or trade items are
available, then a blank tape will be fine. Each of us will pay our own
postage.

Any questions can be directed to me, but ask them soon. I will start taking
requests at 10:00 AM Central Standard Time (USA), Sunday, August 15, 1998.

All tapes from me will be on Maxell XLII 90. I would like the same in
return.

Thanks, and enjoy the show!!

Peace,

Bill

Hey all,

I just recieved the tapes of the recent Dutch Radio 4 show from my friend in
Holland. It's a little less that 4 hours long. It's all in Dutch too, so if
you don't speak the language it'll get a bit boring. There are several
Beefheart interview clips which are very interesting, and a 1993 telephone
call between Beefheart and a Dutch fellow, don't know his name. I think he
might be one of the two guys who are doing the radio show. They play tracks
off of various albums and then talk in Dutch for awhile, then play a rare
interview clip, then converse in Dutch for awhile. There's concert recording
that they play about 1/2 way through the show that is not an official
release, as far as I can tell, since Beefheart never did a live album (other
than "Bongo Fury"), and from what I can gather from the Dutch fellow
afterward it might have been from Amsterdam 1980, or maybe Montreal, I heard
them say that word too. I do know it's from his "Radar Station" tour.
Beefheart, at one point says that he wishes he had a time machine and asks
someone in the crowd where they would go if they had one, and then states
that he would leave the world if he could..... does anyone know what show
this might be?

Also, on one of the tapes, there is some heavy bleed-through on the right
channel that sound like a Crosby, Stills and Nash bootleg show. It lasts
around 20 minutes and interferes to a small degree with one of the
interviews and a couple of songs from "Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)". I
turned the balance knob all the way over to the left and avoided it, a small
annoyance. I think the person I got the tapes from must have used a tape
that was previously recorded on (he's a big CSN freak). I'm just glad that
he was able to tape this show for me.

Anyway, I would like to tree these tapes out to anyone who is interested. I
understand that there's only about 60 of us on the Fire Party, so it should
be pretty easy to get everyone a copy. What I plan to do is to offer the
whole show as is (there's no commercials) to those who want it, but I also
plan to edit it down and take out all the Dutch language stuff and keep the
Beefheart interviews and rare stuff intact. I could maybe get all that down
on one 90 minute tape....I don't know yet. This would make it easier to tree
out and maybe more interesting for all of us non-Dutch speaking Beefophiles.

Incidentally, my friend told me that it seemed to be just the two guys
talking about Beefheart's career and mentioning stuff that any Beefheart fan
would know already. I think it would be cool to get a translated transcript
of their narration and find out for ourselves.

Please e-mail me and give me any ideas on how this should be treed, and
indeed if there is any interest out there in owning this show.

Pullin' on the Bat Chain,

Bill

Me too, me too! I suppose it's works on the basis that I get a copy on the
condition that I make a given number of new copies and mail to others on
the list. And so on...

Having seen the original band once and the later "best batch yet" Williams,
Tepper, Feldman, ect. a half dozen times, I can tell you THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A LIVE BEEFHEART SHOW!!!  From the first note until the finale it was
pure fun.  I couldn't stop smiling.  My face would hurt from grinning.
Everybody in the band was grinning too.  They all seemed to really be having
a good time.  Don would make comments between songs such as after Tepper
would crank out "One Red Rose That I mean" Don would look over the crowd and
proclaim, "He plays that REALLLLLY good!"  And everybody would cheer like
crazy.  During songs Don would walk around to various band members and say
something in their ear that would make them laugh or he would walk up to
Eric "Black Drew Kitipoo" Feldman (who would be wearing his fireman's helmet
playing "Hot Head") and scratch him under his goateed chin the way you might
scratch a cat.  It was great!  The music was LOUD LOUD LOUD and perfectly
played.  These guys were the dictionary deff. of "TIGHT".  Many times I
would be looking around and glance up at Don only to see him looking me
right in the eyes as if he was reading my mind.  Then he would put the bell
of that Soprano sax right over the microphone and blow pure joy.  He would
go off in one direction while the band continued to play the song in the
other direction.
I enjoy listening to a few Beefheart CDs on the headphones too but it's
NOTHING even close to a live show.
If I could jump into Mr. Peabody's Way-Back machine, the only time and place
I would EVER want to go back to would be to see those guys play live again.

'Brown Star' was the album intended to follow 'Spotlight Kid'.  In most
early '72 Interviews Don mentions the album.  He claims it was written in
eight hours (sound familiar ?) on a journey between Boston and Yale.  One of
the tracks was to be 'Big Eyed Beans..' and another was a song written by
Jan called 'Happy Blue Pumpkin'.  Several other reports say that the album
was to also include poems and interviews .. and in the 'Disc & Music Echo'
interview (1st April 1972) it says " ...and there is to be a beautiful
percussion and horn track between Ed and the Captain ['Spitball scalped a
baby ??]. ' I shall play a lot of horn on this album.  Last year I felt like
a harmonica so I wrote 'The Spotlight Kid' on it and played it a lot" '.  I
don't think that what Don says here relates too well to the alleged 'Brown
Star' out-takes ?  To me, they sound much like the 'Spotlight Kid'
material - sorta downbeat and plodding in feel.  But there are lots of
out-takes, rehearsals and instrumental noodlings from the '71 - '72 period.

The 'Brown Star' idea was far enough along to have some publicity material
already prepared.  But, for whatever reason, that project was nixed and
'Clear Spot' took its place.

btw, the Brown Star is the Earth.

As for Don re- using titles and ideas.  This seems to be how he worked.  He
collected any interesting words, phrases or whatever and kept them, stored
in shoeboxes.  He just brought them out when he felt like it.

But I have to agree with Scott about 'Best Batch Yet'.  I always thought
that was about the later Magic Band until I heard a rehearsal tape from '72
on which one of the band clearly name the tune as 'Best Batch Yet' !

Keep on rollin' on
Steve

It looks like Bill Harkleroad's book 'Lunar Notes' is due out anytime  Both
Justin at Homepagereplica and Theo at Electricity have some detail on it if
you haven't already seen it.  They have also listed some places to get it.
Just to add to this, I saw it listed by the London bookshop 'Helter Skelter'
for #11.95 + #1.50 postage.

btw, I was in Waterstones bookshop in York today and they had 2 copies of
'Skeleton Breath Scorpion Blush' in stock !   This is the first time I have
ever seen a copy of this in a bookshop.   It was priced at #18.   When I
bought mine a few years back I had to make a special order through a London
bookshop as no-one else seemed to be able to get it. (the price was much the
same then).

And just out of interest, for all you completists out there ... the
'Nuggets' series of rare '60s psychedelia/garage bands has just been
reissued on a 4-CD set.  Included in this is Don's version of 'Diddy Wah
Diddy'.

Keep on rollin' on
Steve

Gavin wrote about his dissertation on Don's paintings:-
>I have found the internet a useful resource in my investigations of

>my research. And may even prompt others to follow in a similar

>(if so I would definatly like to know, as it would be very useful to

>progress, 

I'm sure we'd be interested in hearing what you have to say about
Don's artwork.  As long as it's not pretentious babble like some of the
stuff A.R.Penck has written about Don.   There were a number of
articles appear in magazines and newspapers a few years ago when
the 'Stand up to be discontinued' exhibition was doing the rounds.

btw, Gavin, if you need details of any of these, let me know.

Keep on rollin' on

I received my tape from Troutmask Roth on Saturday. Thankyou! The 
quality is topnotch and the content nothing short of inspiring. Good job 
Troutmask.

Anyway, I listened to the tape in my wifes walkman while mowing the 
lawn. The neighbors are probably now certain that I am nuts as I had to 
stop the mower frequently to hear what Don was saying. Man with mower 
bent over in thought with no mower. Check biff cotton poppin out of his 
sleeve.

Sheesh, and I only liked Don because he bugged my parents.

And very pleased I was to see this too!  I was reading The Wire late at
night in bed, just about to turn in when I suddenly spotted a familiar
icture - a screen dump from The Radar Station.  I was so shocked - I wanted
to phone everyone up and tell them but unfortunately it was nearly 4 in the
morning and my girlfriend was away for the weekend so there was no one to
tell until the next day!

The Captain Beefheart for Beginners article that you mention from The Wire
is also up at The Radar Station - it's buried away in 'Gimmie Dat Harp Boy'
in the record reviews section - 'The Floppy Boot Stomp'.  It is an excellent
guide to the Captain's albums if you don't have them all and want to know
what to buy next.

While I'm here - I'm compiling a list of Radar Station visitors / Fire Party
members' ICQ numbers.  If you would like to be included on this list, drop
me a line including your ICQ number.

All the best,

Graham <junk@rhubub.globalnet.co.uk>

A while ago a few of you suggested exchanging ICQ numbers.  I've only just
got around to investigating this and now have an ICQ number - it is
18222705.

Feel free to drop me a line.  I am hoping to get my ftp software sorted out
this evening, so hopefully The Radar Station will once again be beaming out
fresh beef.

All the best,

Hello all,

My computer badly screwed itself up yesterday and I've just spent two days
wrestling with it, trying to get it to work again.  Eventually I threw in
the towel and reinstalled Windows, losing a fair few treasured items.  It's
the technological equivalent of your house burning down, I guess.

Everything is working like a dream now, except for my ftp software,
consequently I'm unable to access the Radar Station at the moment to update
it, so things will be fairly quiet there for the next few days.  I could do
with a short break from the computer anyway, frankly I'm sick of it at the
moment.

I'm hoping to get something new up by this weekend, if everything goes to
plan.

I wanted to add this message from Dean Blackwood to the Beefbox update, but
until I can, I'll send it to you:

>Hey guys. Things are still coming together nicely. John French is busy
>on the bulk of the notes and I am attempting to wrap up the recordings
>end of things. Some cool surprises in the works.
>
>Could each of you post that we are looking for good quality versions of
>the following live performances from any era:
>
>Suction Prints/Pompadour Swamp
>Peon
>Dali's Car
>Old Fart
>Well
>Dust Blows
>Apes Ma
>Odd Jobs
>Best Batch Yet
>Owed T'Alex
>
>And, since the BBC has erased its tapes and Peel himself has no tapes,
>we are auditioning versions of the Peel Sessions (all 8 tracks) to see
>who has the best set.

All the best,

Graham <junk@rhubub.globalnet.co.uk>

I unearthed this a little while back and it's up in the poetry section (Life
Walker) of The Radar Station, along with a van Vliet cartoon of the 'Brown
Star'.  It is a very charming and simple poem:

I know of a Brown Star
That only certain people have found
For years they been lookin' around
A lot of people lookin' up
But very few of them looking down
Well they searched high and low for that little glow
That'll make them happy
Some searched fast and they went on past
Some went slow but couldn't let it go
I know of a Brown Star
That only very certain people have found
You can ask a dog why he's so happy
Just waggin' his tail around
Or a frog that makes him jump around
Follow a sailin' cloud until it dumps
The rain right down
But ask a man and woman if they've seen
A Brown Star around
Some will say yes and some will say no
Some will just laugh and some will just glow
Some will say why do you ask
Some will say well don't you know
Then there'll be the one that says
It's already been found
But you ask a child and they'll just jump up and down
Sayin' we found a Brown Star
Right on the ground.

Graham <rhubub@globalnet.co.uk>

I forgot to mention that I am in the process of uploading another complete
show to The Radar Station.  It was available as the Electric Poetry bootleg
and is a gig from Amsterdam in March 1980.  The sound quality is better than
the other shows at The Radar Station, and the gig is fantastic.

Watch out for the bizarre version of Dropout Boogie in which the Captain
half-heartedly speaks the words instead of bellowing them out in the manner
you'd expect - it's pretty weird.

I'm going to upload a tune every day or so until it is all done.  Hope you
enjoy it.

All the best,

Graham <rhubub@globalnet.co.uk>

Hello all,

I've just been sent a message by Dean Blackwood which contained a blurb
about the Captain Beefheart boxset which Revenant are putting out which he
would like me to include in the site which I am designing for them.  I
thought you might be interested:

>For release in early 1999: Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band - Grow Fins
>Essential Rare Recordings (1965-1982) 5 x CD set (enhanced)
>
>Components include:
>-the full, from-the-master tape Trout Mask Replica house sessions
>-Safe as Milk/Strictly Personal demos, outtakes, and alternates
>-unissued recordings from all settings and eras, including those from the
personal >archives of Magic Band members
>-cd-rom accessible video/audio footage of Cannes Beach '68, Paris '73,
Amougies >'69 and other live performances
>
>The set will be housed in a 60+ page hardcover book, with cover art by Cal
Schenkel, >lots of rare photos and memorabilia, and featuring notes by John
"Drumbo" French, >David Fricke and John Corbett.

Most of this you will already know, but I was particularly pleased to hear
that it is now a 5 cd set instead of 4, and that it will contain videos on a
CD-Rom as well.  It gets better all the time.

All the best,

Graham <rhubub@globalnet.co.uk>

Welcome to another Aussie. Jealous that you have seen the cpt & band so
many times.
I have had to satisfy myself with whatever live recordings I can find.
(thankyou Graham)
I was doing some recording a little while back and included some tracks
from London 1974. As much as the general opinion about the tragic band
not making the grade( which I do agree with) I became re-impressed with
the captain's harp playing on that CD. Anyone else noticed how he runs
all over the tragic band with his harp.
Cheers

Well I've not seen any posts about this, so here goes:

The following appears in issue 175 (September 1998) of The Wire.

---------
Captain Beefheart Radio Station

www.beafheart.com

Webwise Beefheart fans have been well served by the long running 'Home
Page Replica (www.shiningsilence.com/hpr/), but here's a worthy new
rival, supplying access to all manner of Beefy trivia, centred closely
around Van Vliet's own texts, surrealistic homilies, and his paintings
(plus commentaries thereon). What'll really push up the hits is the
sister site, 'Filtered Thru Dust Speakers', where - abba zabba! - you
can stream MP3 sound files of Beefheart concerts, the original
unreleased 'Bat Chain Puller' tapes, 'Trout Mask Replica' outtakes,
Peel Sessions, and more, direct to your hard drive. Completists can
ogle a life-size facsimile of Don's birth certificate; while those who
want to gossip on-line can join one of two discussion groups.

Rob Young

----------

Incidently, if anyone missed it, issue 170 of The Wire featured an
article 'Captain Beefheart For Beginners'. Six pages of potted history
and lp reviews. 

The Wire's web site is at www.dfuse.com/the-wire

For faith! Sacre blooper
Sham buckler's borne a pooper
Ursatwhile the former indian

and a mystic oracle recites
through a breather hole tonight

coproscopy: inspection of faeces; divination by inspection of faeces;
hence copro'copist, one who practises coproscopy

Meaning is where anyone cares to find it
The mystery of communication is that meaning overlaps physically
separate minds

Whether it is the meaning that the generator of the work intended is
another matter
If, for the sake of argument--since life is more multiplex and
non-linear anyway--we place unmotivated creation and intentional
production on two poles of a continuum, it doesn't mean that the
unmotivated creation has no meaning. Things with no meaning are
uninteresting; in other words, they literally don't make any difference.

For example, wilderness only becomes generally interesting as a concept
when there's very little of it left. Before that, it is not interesting
as a concept only its potential for material exploitation or escape is
interesting. Before greed had salivared over every last remaining parcel
wilderness was "a tract of solitude and savageness", a thing of pity "O
my poore Kingdome..thou wilt be a Wildernesse againe, Peopled with
Wolues (thy old Inhabitants)."

I agree that few others would arrive at the same destination if you
started off by saying that Peon is about the inhumanity of working in a
factory. On the other hand, Ant Man Bee do seem to preach without
preaching.

The captain seemed to run out anything meaningful to say towards the end
of the aurally creative episode of his life, maybe he tried to
annihilate meaning. Maybe he strived to be as weird as most music
executives thought he must be. Maybe he just got as tired as he sounds
singing Observatory Crest. Maybe he squirted out tubefuls of
tropical-hotdog-night painterly color.

None of that means that he isn't fun to think with.

The man, like all of us, like anything else we think we know, may be
fundamentally unknowable in itself.

OTOH DVV is a creative being rooted in an embodied set of historical
habits, like anyone else. Some habits are just habits. Some are are
originally motivated by a quest for meaning. Some are shared, like
language itself.

The captain's merit was to run rings around habits of music and meaning,
not to escape them.
He animated and rehabituated forms.
He also made sensitive observations

Good poetry may communicate before it's understood but that don't mean
you can't come to an understanding of it.

You can make far more sense out of most of the captain's lyrics than out
of the following:

Thrippy Pillywinx
Inkly tinky pobblebockle able-squabs? Flosky! Beebul trible flosky! Okul
scratch abibblebongibo, viddle squibble tog-a-tog, ferry moyasitty amsky
flamsky crocklefether squiggs.
Flinky wisty pomm.
Slushypipp
Edward Lear, Letter to Evelyn Baring, Lord Cromer (1850)

That's because the captain is open to interpretation and Lear is not.

Products mainly motivated by profit and ones created to give
satisfaction both have meaning, even in their motivation.

Maybe some of the cultural meaning of the captain was longed for
wildness come to a tame scene.

The captain was closer to, but still far from jazz, where recordings are
more evidence of what's happening at that time of recording than
ensemble playing that has to be mastered.

Meanwhile, what is the sound of half a sphincter crapping?

I am with you 100% here. There must be two parties to a communication.
We can interpret only with the faculties that we possess. Even if we
find meaning where none was intended, it doesn't mean that meaning is
not there, but then we are getting into the realms of religion and
sweepin an a sweeping an still there's too many feet.

But why call the captain's lyrical quirks randomness? The term "stream
of consciousness" seems to be relevant, or "automatic writing" as the
surrealists preferred to call it.

the dust blows forward n the dust blows back
an the wind blows black through the sky
an a smokestack blows up in the sun's eye
what am i gonna die
a white flake riverboat just flew by
bubble popped big
an a li
an a lipstick kleenex hung on a point ed fork ed twig
reminds me of the bobby girls
never was my hobby girls
can full o worms an a pole fishin
cork bobbing like a hot red bulb
an blue jay squeaks his beak open an inch above the creek
gone fishin for a week

an I took off my pants and felt free
wind blowin up me
an up the canyon as far as I can see

Verbal improvisation is common in blues , particularly if different
singers take over at different points in the song. John Sebastian was
famous for going on and on in this vein, often with very little point.
Knowing what to leave out is the mark of the true artist.

The captain just had a lively and imaginative mind. He was, to the the
concerned-with-appearances-world around him, weird. He didn't always
care if the words made instant sense, and sometimes maybe he
experimented with Edmund-Lear-type nonsense. Often he went for
sensuality and visuals. Things like Smithsonian Institute Blues, with
the music striding like a dinosaur skeleton in a song about extinction.
Or the humorous Buggy Boogie Woogie (imagine a comedian acting out
finding the spiders nest and trying to sweep up those spiders) that also
says something about the open-endedness and unfinished nature of human
thought (IMHO).

With the captain the medium is the message--right, right, just dig
it--whereas commercial music is crafted to get across some kind of
saleable feeling, and the words work towards that end:

It's like honey
When it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey

(I feel as if I have been using bad language in the wrong company by
posting these really rather obscene lyrics here: I heard the song once
and threw up inwardly--I refreshed my memory at
The International Lyrics Server http://www.lyrics.ch/)

David Bowie has said that he tried to incorporate randomness into his
songwriting by writing lines, chopping them up, and selecting bits at
random.

The captain didn't need to do this, he could pluck poetry ripe from his
mind. I don't think that drugs are responsible, it's the person that is
released by them, but I do think that the captain was stoned a lot of
the time, or else he often ate cheese before going to sleep. He arranges
what he found in his mind to his own taste. One thing that he seemed to
be keen on was keeping the playfulness. The idea of play in
communication later became important in French linguistic philosophy.
The captain never said it in so many words, but his famous comment about
Zappa, "He's a worker and I'm a player", bears this out. Someone who was
famous for forcing the band to get it right, a player? The play is
elsewhere.

In a time when being weird was an end itself, the captain was
unfortunate to be born 30 or 40 years too late for surrealism and Dada.
Few people were able to understand his seriousness, both as a human and
as an artist.

Musically I've always thought of the captain as a "blues cubist", a
deconstructionist before post modernism became fashionable. Unlike more
canny artistic operators (Bowie in particular) the captain was innocent,
a comet of aural artistry who blazed all too briefly.

skin as smooth as a daisy in the center where the sun shines in.

Good People,
First of all Arild Stromsvaag rules for sending me an excellent NTSC copy of
the BBC documentary, wich I am enjoying right now.  Too bad Don never had
the backing in the states that he had with John Peel.
I have ordered "Electricity" from Music Bulivard, but its been on backorder
for tthe last 3 weeks and I fear that I wont get it.  How many of you have
that?  Is it worth getting all worked up over.  I would just get safe as
milk on CD if I could find it.  (Some of you may remember, I'm the early
Beefheart purist)
For my European friends, Can you just find Electricity in the shops
everywhere?  Whats the deal.  Can I ever hope to get this?  It seems strange
to me that this, a fairly new album, is on backorder.  I think its the fact
that its an import.
Please someone help me.
Also, am I correct in thinking that the Revenet thing is coming out in
November?  Thats what I heard originally, but the website that was floating
around on this post said February.  I don't know if I can wait this long.
Finally, my take on Live Beef vs Recorded Beef:  Live Beef was probably
great.  Recorded live Beef is shit.  Since I can't go back in time, I'm
happy with the recordings.

I really loved the Safe as Milk interpretation.  That's the thing about
Beefheart.  I never found him to be a lyric genius.  I always liked his
singing and loved his songwriting abilities, but I always thought the lyrics
were sort of coming from the Diddy-Wah-Diddy school of thought.  Clearly
the thing about Beefheart will most often be his songwriting ability, but up
till now I've been missing a large part of the picture.  Safe as milk works
great with that explanation.
By the way, I have to admit that I have always really admired Beefheart's
R&B stuff.  I think its gone mostly overlooked.  There is no "I'm Glad" or
"Too Much Time" on LMDOB.  And while I like LMDOB, it has always been the
hardest one for me to get into.  Too much meat & potatoes, and not enough
desert.  Songs like this really showcased Don's voice more.  And I agree
with Ry Cooder in the BBC documentary, that "Autumn's Child" is one of the
best that lineup of the Magic Band ever produced.  By the way, am I crazy to
draw similarities with Don and Van Morrison's R&B work.  The improvisational
Jazz feel, the Howls, The phrasing.  Anyway.  Think about it........

I agree wholeheartedly with Michael - it was a treat to be mere feet away
from the Captain, but the music's been best on the recordings. Some of the
live recordings are quite unlistenable because of Beefheart's inability to
sing his own songs right. Perhaps if I'd been fortunate enough to see the
original band...

<DIV>&quot;In dem lyrics....(the shiniest beast in his 3 pronged aural

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Truly one of the most insightful, concise descriptions of Beefheart's art 
I've ever seen - thanks, pal. Your pointed 'n pithy analogy notwithstanding, 
you've done some analysis yourself. I wouldn't compare the Captain's poetry to a 
pile of bear shit, since the former came from a (sub?)conscious creative 
process, the latter from an autonomic digestive one. Not spectacularly 
flattering, besides. But your point is well taken - another day, another 
way...</DIV>

Oh - and just a small bit of trivia: Joni Mitchell, interviewed in the
latest issue of Mojo magazine, is another musician who's taken up brush and
easel. She think's Don's painting is great. (I don't have the mag right
here, right now, so I can't give the exact quote.)

>Gavin wrote about his dissertation on Don's paintings:-

A dissertation was recently submitted at the Dept. where I work. It's not
on Don's painting, I'm afraid, but rather an analysis fron an art
historian's point of view of the rock photography of Anton Corbijn and
another photographer. I don't know if Don's even mentioned in the
dissertation, though, and it's probably in Norwegian. But if you would like
me to find out more, let me know.

regards,

Arild

The Norwegian radio dj Harald Are Lund introduced me and a lot of other
Norwegian listeners to Captain Beefheart. My own first recollection, is of
'We're All Brothers Of Tomorrow'. I had it on tape, followed by 'Baron
Saturday' (from 'S.F. Sorrow') by The Pretty Things. Later, I recall a
program one summer where he played 'Dachau Blues'. The man is almost an
institution in Norway. At present, he has a weekly show every Thursday. And
on every program he plays one Beefheart track. If you go to
<http://www.nrk.no/petre/roxrevyen/torsdag/spillelister/>, you can check
out his playlists. (He has probably played a weekly track for longer than
these lists show, though.) This is the largest channel in Norway, and until
recently it held a more or less a monopolic grasp on Norwegian air-waves.
(The complete alphabetic play-lists 1996-98 are at
<http://home.sol.no/~herjulv/docelbow/hal9000.html>.) It's not that a lot
of you will have any chance of hearing this guy's program, but he's efforts
on behalf of Captain Beefheart (and other good music) definitely deserves a
mention!

Hello Fire Party,

I've been getting the mail now from you guys for some weeks and thought it
about time to introduce myself. I am a writer and photographer living in
London. I work a lot in the Middle East and North Africa, especially Libya.
Completely addicted to deserts. Try playing TMR in the middle of a sand sea
if you get the chance. 
	Been a closet Beefheart fan for ages.. My first introduction was on Willie
the Pimp. Hot Rats found me when I was 16 and I have always been into Zappa
and Beefheart. The turning  point was in the early 70s, London, Royal
Albert Hall of all places. A red plush introduction to a great artist. My
sweet, but very conservative local newsagent was part-time usher at the
Albert Hall and had a free box to all the concerts. He offered me tickets
to Beefheart and the Magic Band - not just tickets, a whole gilded box. God
knows, he didn't want them. The concert was amazing - among the last before
the Albert Hall put a stop to rock concerts (after Zappa' s attempt to put
on 200 Motels there). I still recall it as one of the most intense and
brilliant concerts I have ever been to.
	Years passed. Life diversified and it's only recently I have rediscovered
the Captain's music. It was great to find the Fire Party. Still don't know
how to download stuff from the web- this new technology kills me. Would
have liked to hear this broadcast you were talking about.
	Love to hear from you all......

Ann Jousiffe

I have seen a few copies of Safe as Milk on CD over the past few years.
If I see one again, I'll let you know.

What's on "Eletricity"?  Is it just the Safe as Milk tracks re-ordered?

Thanks,

Sam

          I saw Captain Beefheart twice, once in 1971 and then again
when Doc at the Radar Staion came out.  I've got to agree with Voot --
the Magic Band live were incredible both times, but especially the 1971
version with Drumbo, Ed Marimba, Rockette Morton and Zoot Horn Rollo.

          First Ed Marimba came out dressed in a smoking jacket and
wearing a monocle.  He took some opera glasses out of his pocket and
looked at the audience through them, then reached into another pocket
and pulled out one of those sparkle shooting plastic guns at us.  All
with no music.  Then Drumbo came out with some plastic hammers that made
a noise when you hit them.  Ed Marimba started jamming along on the
marimba, two mallets in each hand.  The song turned into Alice in
Blunderland when Rockette Morton danced his way onstage with his
double-necked Danelectro Longhorn.  (Winged Eel Fingerling had just left
the band a few weeks before, so Rockette Morton played a little on the
guitar neck a few times, but mostly he used the bass neck.)  He danced
the entire time the band played.

          You could hear the guitar part but you couldn't see who was
playing it.  Suddenly Zoot Horn Rollo jumped from nowhere OVER his
amplifier (an Acoustic stack, I think) playing the riff from When Big
Joan Sets Up!!  Voot is 100% right about the Magic Band being loud and
tight -- the bass was a fundamental rumble, contrasting with the clear
high notes of the marimba, all glued together by Zoot Horn Rollo's
Telecaster.  This was the first ten minutes of the set and the crowd
(800-1000?) was already on its feet, roaring with all its might!

          Captain Beefheart hadn't even stepped on stage yet!!

Having seen the original band once and the later "best batch yet" Williams,
Tepper, Feldman, ect. a half dozen times, I can tell you THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A LIVE BEEFHEART SHOW!!!  From the first note until the finale it was
pure fun.  I couldn't stop smiling.  My face would hurt from grinning.
Everybody in the band was grinning too.  They all seemed to really be having
a good time.  Don would make comments between songs such as after Tepper
would crank out "One Red Rose That I mean" Don would look over the crowd and
proclaim, "He plays that REALLLLLY good!"  And everybody would cheer like
crazy.  During songs Don would walk around to various band members and say
something in their ear that would make them laugh or he would walk up to
Eric "Black Drew Kitipoo" Feldman (who would be wearing his fireman's helmet
playing "Hot Head") and scratch him under his goateed chin the way you might
scratch a cat.  It was great!  The music was LOUD LOUD LOUD and perfectly
played.  These guys were the dictionary deff. of "TIGHT".  Many times I
would be looking around and glance up at Don only to see him looking me
right in the eyes as if he was reading my mind.  Then he would put the bell
of that Soprano sax right over the microphone and blow pure joy.  He would
go off in one direction while the band continued to play the song in the
other direction.
I enjoy listening to a few Beefheart CDs on the headphones too but it's
NOTHING even close to a live show.
If I could jump into Mr. Peabody's Way-Back machine, the only time and place
I would EVER want to go back to would be to see those guys play live again.
Voot

Sorry Folks - I'm still here and willing to copy/despatch the tapes (I

I have sent Bill my postal address by separate e-mail so don't be too
concerned that I appeared to be missing in action.

Hi,

I very interested in getting a copy of the tape - I'm not familiar with
the concept of a tape tree though. How does this work??

I notice the original Bat Chain Puller is not mentioned. Does that mean it is

Any idea of the cost yet?

Ben,	
	Actually, I just realized that my following post to the FireParty
actually seems to be going to your e-mail address alone, rather than to
FireParty. Oh well. I'll figure out Netscape better some day. I listen
to O Solo Drumbo almost constantly lately. I get restless when I hear.
it. I think that the group of people who are proud owners of O Solo
Drumbo is a very special group, and I am happy to see that the group is
bigger than I thought.

					Cheers,
							Michael H.

	Oh yah. You should check out the alt.fan.capt-beefheart newsgroup.
There are a few threads going involving O Solo Drumbo and the whole
issue of French's role in the Magic Band.  He drummed on Sheriff of Hong
Kong. Did you know that? I didn't until a chain thoughts made me
erroneously connect 1010th Day of the Human Totem Pole with something
Robert Williams said in an interview with Scott MacFarland that can be
found at Home Page Replica. Because 1010th was on O Solo Drumbo with the
melodies being played with tuned toms, I figured he must have had a big
role in it, and it is a complicated story. So complicated, in fact, that
I think that you'd have to be Charlie Chan to really understand it.
	The thing that struck me about O Solo Drumbo right off is the way he
plays this conceptually ingenious stuff in such a nonchalant drumming
style. This is not a drummer that ever practised flamadiddles for eight
hours a day, at least that is my guess. Thank goodness. He just nails
it. I don't know anything about painting, but perhaps Van Vliet's art
has that same sacrifice of technique to go for the long ball. That is
great that you bought O Solo Drumbo. Man, those liner notes are really
funny also. The track that just tears up the part of me that is
methodical is "Three For 5". Or 345. Playing in three different time
signatures simultaneously. (And it is in 3/8, 4/4 and 5/4 ,which adds a
third level to the pun.) That's what polyrhythms are about, but in this
case what the high-hat is doing is really a stretch if you are trying to
understand it all together. I can't believe a human being could play
that.

Hi

Does anyone on this discussion group know of any blues songs that the
Captain used as a basis for his own songs. To set the ball rolling
'Moonlight on Vermont' has a section very similar to Robert Wilkin's
'old time religion' which has the same lyrics as the end of Beefheart's
song and also has a similar melodic structure.

G'day Beefpersons
Fancy some new Beef blabber & smoke on the net?
I now have my website running. The beef page is a small portion of whole, but here
are a swag of digitised photos taken from various video sources which may be of
interest and  two reviews of 72/73 Beef shows and my trade list . Follow the Live
Music Emporium link till you get to the BEEF.
Theres also much Robyn Hitchcock, Richard Thompson ,Womadelaide
festivals,Australian  Grateful dead fanbase page etc. Give it a try.
http://210.8.25.3/sharkfiles/

Any innacuracies etc, private-mail , I'm not absolutely sure of some of the
sources of the vid stuff, so correct me if I've wrongly attributed anything.
dave .

I think possibly the most obvious is Tarotplane. He took the title from
Robert Johnston's "Terraplane" and made the music from Son House's
"Grinnin' in Your Face" as well as a kind of amalgam of other blues songs.
Anyone remember where the "long black wavy mane" and "long as you can
boogie, you ain't too old" were taken from? It seems I heard a Howlin' Wolf
song on the radio recently with similar lyrics.

"Grown So Ugly" is a cover (anyone remember the writer's name?).



Within a progressively improved scaffolding of assumptions,


scott

Interesting that you should post this, Keith,  because I've just been
putting
a tape together of such songs.  This is what I have so far :-

Chuck Berry
              Almost Grown (unreleased recording from '64/'65)
John Lee Hooker
              Black Snake (regular live song on '72/'73 tours)
              Tupelo, Mississippi
Howlin Wolf
              Down in the Bottom (inspires 'Sure nuff...')
              Evil (early Magic Band live song)
              My Country Sugar Mama (live song '73 tour)
              Natchez Burning (live song '75 tour)
              Smokestack Ligtnin (inspires 'Plastic Factory')
              Spoonful (riff reversed for 'Gimme Dat Harp')
              Somebody Walking In My House (early Magic Band live song)
              Three Hundred Pounds Of Joy ('Hoy, Hoy' line used in 'Big
Joan')
              Wang Dang Doodle (inspies 'I'm Gonna Booglarise Ya baby' ?)
Blind Willie Johnson
              Need Somebody On You Bond (played live '68 and '74)
Robert Johnson  (listen these then listen to the 'Strictly Personal'
guitars)
             Terraplane Blues (inspires 'Tarotplane' title)
              If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day
              Travellin Riverside Blues
Hambone Willie Newbern
              Roll & Tumble Blues
              (first ever recording of this song - any version could be
inspiration
               for 'Sure nuff...' but was probably Muddy Waters one)
Lightnin Slim
              Mighty Crazy (played live '74)
Slim Harpo
              King Bee (played live '73)
Son House
              Death Letter Blues (inspiration for 'I feel like ahcid')
Sonny Terry & Brownie McGee
              Key To The Highway ( played on '71/'72 out-takes)
Muddy Waters
              Hoochie Coochie Man (played live '76)
              Rollin n Tumblin (played live '68 and '76)
Robert Pete Williams
              (Grown So) Ugly

I'm sure there are more.  If anyone has suggestions, let me know.  Maybe
when
I get a few more we could tree a tape ?

Keep on rollin' ('n' tumblin') on
Steve

I think it fair to suggest that "Gimme Dat Harp Boy" is based on Willie
Dixon's "Spoonful"

Ken has just written about 'Grown So Ugly' in reply to Scott:-
>The CD says the author is Robert Pete Williams, (the blues artist from
>the late 50's ?)
>> 
>

I've got a copy of Robert Pete's original version which is called 'Ugly'
on the cover and 'I've Grown So Ugly' on the sleevenotes.  It came out
in 1966 on the 'Louisiana Blues' album (on Takoma - John Fahey's 
old label).   From what I understand it was Ry Cooder who suggested
doing this song for SAM.  There seems to have been some additional lyrics
written but the distinctive guitar opening is pretty true to the original.

Robert Pete served time for murder at the infamous Angola prison
in the 50's.  He died in 1980 aged 66.  If you like your blues rough
edged, check him out.

Keep on rollin' on
Steve

In all the writings I have encountered concerning Messr. Van Vliet, I
have not seen any behavioral discussions revolving around what may be an
explanation for some of his mannerisms.
I don't want this discussion to start a "fire".
Many very intelligent and talented artists have bipolar disorder: this
condition frequently causes disruptive behavior, flights of ideas,
grandiose thinking, and (the other side) withdrawal/depression.  It can
be treated biologically with medication, but this will certainly quash
the "madman's" creativity.
I am of the impression that this man and his life indicate the signs of
this.  I would be interested in hearing from other professionals, if
there are any in the Fire Party.

well i read the the real frank zappa book that the bongo fury tour (in
which captain beefheart was singing) was a very tough tour. zappa
specificly talked about how captain beefheart carried most all of his
worldly possessions around with him. mainly books. but that it he kept
leaving his bags in forgotten places. zappa said it was very nerve
racking,... not the zappa doesnt seem to be a bit uptight already. i
dont know too many personal stories about dons life. could some of you
old timers tell some tales?

About a week ago I posted the folowing about the song
'Grown So Ugly' :-

<I've got a copy of Robert Pete's original version which is called 'Ugly'
on the cover and 'I've Grown So Ugly' on the sleevenotes.  It came out
in 1966 on the 'Louisiana Blues' album (on Takoma - John Fahey's 
old label).   From what I understand it was Ry Cooder who suggested
doing this song for SAM.  There seems to have been some additional lyrics
written but the distinctive guitar opening is pretty true to the original.>

I was partly right but Henry Kaiser has kindly sent me the following
full information:-

<actually no new lyrics were written for SAFE AS MILK version
they lyrics are a composite put together by Ry
from two quite different versions of the song on
two different RPW LPs.

I'VE GROWN SO UGLY from the RPW Bluesville 1028 FREE AGAIN
and
UGLY from RPW Takoma B-1011 LOUISIANA BLUES>

Thanks Henry for that.  But that now means I have another song to
track down !!!

Keep on rollin' on
Steve

I would tend to agree for the most part. Don shows all the signs. But 
this begs the question is it truly a disorder? I mean I would think of 
it in a more positive light. It seems more to be truly feeling life, and 
would not see why anyone would want to get this treated with chemicals. 
Well I sure many disagree, but that is my opinion.

Mangling your own career and having to control the people around you is 
not "truly feeling life".  Think I sound somewhat bitter?  Try talking to 
anyone (and I mean anyone) that was in the band.

Don Van Vliet was a startlingly innovative musician, but not a hero.  Do 
not confuse musical expressiveness with being a good person.  The man is 
not the  music.  This is a harsh statement, but after years of seeing 
sycophantic email about the fellow and contrasing it with the stories and 
interviews I've done, I'm plain fed up.

There.  You've now all seen my once-a-year chunk of vitriol.

Justin

Hmm? I know he controled people extremely, but I did not know about 
mangling his career. Could you please share more on this?

I have actually heard the opposite, that he actually worked to make some 
slightly comercial music in the early seventies. (This is from Ben 
Watson's book "The Negative Dialect of Poodle Play" for anyone 
interested.)

Oh and also, I just got a message telling me that Bipolar is actually a 
condition in which you can not function, so I do not think that Don had 
this extreme of a level. Kraig Ward (who sent the message to me)said he 
felt it was probably the lesser version if anything.

He didn't tour for about a year, choosing instead to make the band 
practice Trout Mask Replica endlessly.  It didn't need a year of practice.

He canceled shows, or would walk out on performances he didn't feel like 
doing.  (There's some details on this in Bill Harkleroad's new book)  He 
just plain wouldn't sing much if he didn't feel like doing a show.  His 
temper and paranoia ruined a lot of relationships that would otherwise 
have been fruitful.  Ry Cooder, for instance.

>I have actually heard the opposite, that he actually worked to make some

Actually, it was just that when the Magic Band quit, he got paired with a 
band that was just bad.  It's a telling point that he really didn't 
release anything new after about 1975.  It think I mostly get tweaked 
because the music was a result of the whole band, and he seems to get the 
lion's share of the credit.  Read Bill Harkleroad's book for a more 
accurate picture.  There's other books on the way that will also be more 
realistic.  

I don't have time to type on this more - I should.  Someone remind me...

Justin

I guess this is something that we all need to remember, our idols may have
feet of clay. 
Musicians are not gods,but yet we often  treat them as so. 
I'm prepared to recognise thet Don was probably extremely difficult to work
with and his eccentricites and inability to work well with others  also
eventually affected his career in music. Its interesting that he has retreated
into an artistic phase which he probably finds easier to cope with , as
interpersonal contact is far less important in this sphere.
Anyone who has ever worked in a band will testify that is vital to get on
well, or the unit is doomed to eventual self destruction. No doubt Don also
caused a great deal of resentment to his sidemen over the years as their
contributions were often not acknowledged . This is understandable and perhaps
the various websites that we are compiling will help  to get their
contibutions recognised by more Beefheads .    
 
Conversely,we also have to recognise that Don's music is a product of Don's
personality and its possible that if you removed the 'difficult " aspects of
his persona he would not have created the wildly original music that we all
love. Many people who are gifted artistically have abrasive aspects to their
characters. Lennon, Garcia,Zappa to take a few .As long as we don't deify them
and accept their flaws as regretable  thats ok, but total hero worship of the
fawning kind is just unacceptable and I have to agree with Justin on this
point.

Hey,

I just gotta say, if anyone's in doubt about Beefheart's temper and apparent
instability, read the many accounts from the various Magic Band members
published over the years.

Then go listen to the "Ice Cream For Crow" Outtakes. The man cusses and
berates his musicians to no end. I had the feeling that if it had been me
there during those sessions, I would have made hamburger out of Beefheart. I
applaud the musicians who believed in the music enough to put up with Don's
temper and apparent disregard for thier feelings. He WAS the boss, yes, but
that was ridiculous.

I love Don and his wonderful, tasty and intelligent music but I'm afraid I
wouldn't have been able to stand that for long. He had a strong bunch
working for him, I'll tell ya that.

Bill

In reference to your virtiolic outburst - didn't Art Tripp say he'd worked
for the two biggest assholes in the business? (Elliot Ingber was certainly
no Zappa fan, either, but I don't recall him dissing Don)
