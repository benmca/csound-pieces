Hi,

I tried posting some new reverbs to the list but they have not come through
yet (maybe they were to big) so I put them at my web site:

http://www.werewolf.net/~hljmm/csound/verb.orc
http://www.werewolf.net/~hljmm/csound/verb.sco

Enjoy,

Hi,

I took one of my reverbs and turned it into a waveguide instrument which
sounds somewhat like a bowed string.

Good Luck,

under

i assume you are using powermac csound.
batch files are just text files-use any text editor.

or just change settings in the interface itself.

struggling WEB developer and Computer artist who supported himself by
selling computers. Now all that is just a somewhat neglected hobby. I am a
lot better now but I don't think I will be starting up the company (The
Image Mill) again. Even my web page is mostly defunct.
	But I am using PovRay again and will be making some animations in which I
hope to include audio. This is my interest in CSound.

some Organic veggies, tend bonsai, attend a lot of Physical Therapy and hope
to renew my thirty year long interest in Aikido. I have a part time job, but
mostly I am a house husband and Home Schooler.

Hi all, my name is Kathy and I'm new to csound.

My background is as an optical engineer.  After a few years as a university
professor in optics, I decided to go back and study music.  I'm about done
with coursework for a PhD in music theory.  This semester I'm doing a
little research project on sound synthesis and this is why I'm here.

Last weekend I downloaded csound 3.485 for the macintosh.  I am unable to
get it working.  I followed the instructions in the readme file, looked at
various web sites and the manual and haven't gotten anywhere.  It shouldn't
require 2 PhD's to figure this out.

I have a G3 PowerMac running system 8.1.  The program comes up.  I was
somehow able to get 'firsttest' to run once - that wasn't the first time I
tried it.  It won't run again.  And I can't get any of the other examples
running either.  It opens 'perf', I see the transport window, it then
immediately  closes without doing anything and no explanation.

My question.  I am wondering if there are things about system 8.1 causing
the trouble?  What about directories?  Anything else anyone can think of?

Thanks for your help....

hi kathy,
it sounds like a bug that was occuring sometimes but i thought went away.

1) maybe try getting new version 3.485.1 from the ftp site...

2) could you also save text output as listing file and post that to the list (if
anything)?

3) have you tried other files from other directories?

4) have you thought about getting a phd in computer science?

-matt
p.s. anyone else EVER experience this in the lastest few PPC versions??

Hi,
	I am a povray user (Win 98 on a PII 400) who heard that there was a
synthesizer program that "was to music what povray is to graphics" so I am
trying it.
	I'm just starting to read the manual so I don't even have any intelligent
questions yet but I wanted to introduce myself.
	Well, maybe one question... is there something for Windows (besides
csounder) that will send the command line but allows one to adjust the
arguments directly?
	I'm thinking just some check boxes and a few text fields with a couple of
file selection windows. I almost started to make one myself, but I have so
much to do already...

	all comments welcome...

I remember I had a similar problem initially.  What you may want to
check is first of all what the command line looks like by selecting
Compile -> View Command Line,
and using that command line (which are actually the parameters given to
Csound) to run Csound.  This will give you a chance to see any error
messages that might be generated.  In my case the problem was the use of
the Windows-specific parameter -e, which for some reason is not
recognized in the standard Csound Windows executables.  For that matter,
none of the Windows-specific parameters seem to be recognized.  Anyway,
you can set the presence or absence of parameters like -e in the Global
-> Options menu of Visorc.  And I can attest, Visorc does create sound
files on Windows 95.  Hope this helps.

perhaps somebody can help me getting visorc 1.75 to work on my win95

i installed visorc 1.7 and the upgrade to 1.75.
and i am unable to prduce sound.

i tried the versions in
csound_con.zip
csound95.zip
csound_win.zip

and i don't manage.

is there any magic parameter i don't know for configuring?
csound is started, but i always get a message

no sound file was made

starting csound manually, however, produces sound files.


please help me

your C code looks almost the same as SAOL code.  (although im not really
familiar with it or never figured out its intended use)

with the new macro implementation by john, you can do similiar (but not as
elegent) things inside csound itself:

#define CHORUS(Out#Amp#Note#Fn) #
	a1  oscili $Amp*.33, $Note, $Fn
	a2  oscili $Amp*.33, $Note * .996, $Fn
	a3  oscili $Amp*.33, $Note * 1.004, $Fn
   
	$Out = a1 + a2 + a3
#

	instr 1
iChorusAmp 	= 	p4
iChorusNote = 	cpspch(p5)
iChorusFn 	= 	p6

$CHORUS(aChorusOut#iChorusAmp#iChorusNote#iChorusFn)

	out	aChorusOut
	
	endin

John and others,
	i found a bug in macro code:
rdorch.c, line 302 (in rdorch())
change:
	else if (c == '#' && linepos==0) {
to:
	else if (c == '#' && linepos==1) {

i assume linepos check is there so that all
#define's and #include's can only occur
first character on a line, but linepos gets
automatically incremented to 1 after first
char in line is read..

They should have code from the book freely available on the net.
But last time I tried the server was down.
I don't remember the address, but I did a search for
"Numerical Recipes"

First of all, I would like to thank everybody who joined this thread.
I've learned a lot and I can now see that there is still a lot more to
learn.

I have been pondering over this problem a bit and I even made the
daring attempt to write a CSound orc/sco 'program' in a structured
way. I know that 'structured' and 'object-oriented' are not the same,
but I think that the step from CSound to OO must enivetably go via
something structured.

I took the Toot4 example from Richard Boulanger's "An Instrument
Design Tutorial", because it's simple and straightforward, and there
is something in there that could perhaps be re-used (the chorus). 
I hope the structured version is clear enough, I took the liberty of
inventing a couple of new typedefs (audio, control, ftab), and I added
to the out () function 2 parameters: start and duration.

//
//  instr 4                            ; toot4.orc
//   iamp    = ampdb(p4)               ; convert decibels to linear amp
//   iscale  = iamp * .333             ; scale the amp at initialization
//   inote   = cpspch(p5)              ; convert "octave.pitch" to cps
//   k1  linen     iscale, p6, p3, p7  ; p4=amp
//   a3  oscil     k1, inote*.996, 1   ; p5=freq
//   a2  oscil     k1, inote*1.004, 1  ; p6=attack time
//   a1  oscil     k1, inote, 1        ; p7=release time
//   a1  =         a1 + a2 + a3 
//       out       a1             
//  endin     
//
//  f1 0 4096 10 1                 ; sine wave
//;instr start dur  amp(p4) freq(p5) attack(p6) rel(p7)
//  i4   0     1    75      8.04     .1         .7
//  ...
//e


//Now in C-style CSound

ftab ftSine;

audio Chorus (control cSignal,
              audio a1,
              float fFreq)
{
   float fNote = cpspch (fFreq);
   audio a1 = oscil (cSignal, fNote, ftSine);
   audio a2 = oscil (cSignal, fNote * .996, ftSine);
   audio a3 = oscil (cSignal, fNote * 1.004, ftSine);

Hum, I'm not quite sure I can follow... How do you come up to the "nine 
bands
of wavelet coefs in the range Nyquist freq - 40 Hz (if sr=44 kHz)" ? I'm not 
by the slightest chance an expert on this stuff, you know
As I see it, each successive aplication of the filters analyses data an 
octave lower, and thought that was all there is to it, but I've never really 
studyed the nr code, nor implemented it yet

There are more articles around. Not too digestable, some of them, but there 
is wickerhauser's original article, as well as some followups, even a GA 
approach to find best wave-packets for synthesis (get'em all from 
www.mathsoft.com/wavelets.html). And who doesnt need more data compression 
and denoising in their music? :)
No, really, I think theres promissing ground for the future, altho I agree 
some has to be perfected first, if there is to be a real useful musical 
usage

I'm not defending one thing over the other. Its all a matter of what you 
have, or dont. If there is a better method, I'm sure someone will use it, 
but so far I have no knowledge of it. And as you say, the great advantage of 
wavelets, over sines and cosines, is their compat localization in freq AND 
in space

yep, I could use a math degree, or at least a couple o'brains more

(I read up on this stuff some time ago, but my weakness 
in math probably causes some malapropisms anyway.)
Note that the Numerical Recipes code as it stands performs 
octave-band analysis, that is, it will yield nine bands 
of wavelet coefs in the range Nyquist freq - 40 Hz (if sr=44 kHz). 
This is good for applications like denoising and compression, 
but not generally for the kind of spectral manipulation that 
computer musicians might desire - I think that would require at 
least three bands per octave (and preferably variable bandwidth).
I hope someone who understands the math can adapt the code 
however, so this need not be a serious objection.

I also found exactly one article about wavelets and music. 
It's by Peter Meijer (author of the Java image/sound applet).
Basically, he contends that we should indeed have multi-resolution 
analysis, but that it need not necessarily of the constant-Q kind 
that wavelets use (where the analysis window width is exactly 
proportional to the frequency). His conclusion is that variable-
windowed Fourier transforms might be at least as good as wavelets. 
(Intuitively, I'd think that it seems good to have co/sines as 
the base, because we know what to do with them, and what happens 
when we manipulate them.)
But see for yourselves:
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Peter_Meijer/wavelet.htm

(When checking back that the links still work, I noted a MA thesis 
on the net, which deals with wavelets for electromusical purposes, 
but this also only treats octave-band wavelets for denoising and 
"spectral enhancement" of compressed audio:
http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~coreyc/thesis/thesis_html/title.html )

It might have been posted, but anyway here is the main entry point 
for those who want to know more about wavelets:
http://www.amara.com/current/wavelet.html

Note that most articles you find on the net are either very general 
or require a bit of maths.

AIFF floats are now done with AIFC with a "compression" style for
floats.  This is the code used in SoundHack and the Mills port.  I am
willing to befieve that there are problems though as this code was
rather difficult (to me anyway).  Do you still have problems?

Hi everybody!

Is there some other way to recognize MIDI data from multiples channels
on RT CSound without using the MIDI deriver trick that is  descripted
on the RT CSound documentation?
And, another question... do anybody have troubles to manage MIDI
controller number above 90. We try de MIDI controller 100, and RT
CSound seems not be capable to handle it (ignores it).

Thanks a lot, and regards.

Sebastin

I'm so sorry, but in my haste to send this last instr I missed a small bug. 
It doesnt change much, but caused vertical positioning to be uncentered 
sometimes. Here's the correct version
Sorry for the inconvenience,
pedro

I dont think it would be harder to encode FFT than it is to encode a wavelet 
instrument. Both cases use a convolution and perform the computation in 
place. Using the FFT/Wavelet code at Numerical Recipes (in case anyone 
missed it, its FREE online)  its easy to port to csound. The expected 
computational effort would be similar to wavelet's as well. I just choosed 
wavelets cause their more amusing, and seem to be well suited for describing 
complex signals like sound, due to its multi-resolution analysis.
I can send a conventional wavelet instr (in a couple of days...), that lets 
you apply the FWT (fast wavelet transform) to an audio signal, and the IFWT 
(inverse-FWT) to the wavlet coefs, to reconstruct it back. Much of it, as 
well as the programming philosophy, can be used in the design of a FFT 
instr. Of course, a couple of dedicated ugens is much better (altho maybe 
not so educative)
Btw, I totally agree our computers can very well deal with FFT computation 
_inside_ csound, and am looking forward for the new ugens

I gave up on doing this inside csound, because of latency issues.  So I wrote
my own programs to do it.  If you use a Mac, you can try GrainWave (which does
this) or my upcoming release of an easy-to-use effects processor that emulates
having a box full of effects pedals.

Hey , I was wondering if anybody has this problem except me.
When I work with my MIDI controller (Peavey-PC1600)  and RT1.9 ,
sometimes one movement
of  a fader re-initializes all other faders.

Thanks in advance,

Hi,
I'm kind of new on the list (4 months) but an avid user of Csound from
about version 3.45.
Although I'm using RT1.9 quite a lot lately, I still have a few fences
to jump.
I'v been looking into a specific problem I'm having latley.

I'll use the "delay.orc/sco" example codes to explain what I'm looking
for.
The delay example recieves WAVE IN and the instrument is activated in
the sco(.. i1 0 3600 ..).

[Btw, there is also the 'f0 600' statement there.Is it for real-time
performance in general or
 like I think it states in the manual, for MIDI real-time performance]

If I now want to add MIDI controlers (e.g. 'kfdbk midic7 1,0,1')I must,
for some reason,
abandon the idea of activating the instr from sco and it seems like I
now need to activate it
"manually", (wich means pressing a button on the PC1600 MIDI controller
and keeping it there).
There seems to be a clash between the score's i statement & the orc's
midi controllers.
When I don't remove the i statment & use MIDI controllers in the orc -
RT crashes(probably with good reason)

Naturally I also rechecked my command line flgas and they seem in order
-
alowing MIDI IN,WAVE IN etc.


Any help will be much apriciated.

Thanks,
       Yair Kass

just broke down and picked up the L1, which is billed as a limiter. there
are quite a number of companies that are coming out with these devices,
including digidesign, but word on the street is that Waves L1 (available as
part of Native Power Pack which includes eq, compressor, dithering...) is
still the one.

ok, might not be any faster to use if you manage to set an instrument up in
csound. and this is way over my head anyway. what i meant was that they
require minimum tweaking and still do a great job. and about their alleged
intelligence. a wild guess. they may actually be far more complicated than
even multiband limiters. according to the box, L1 does look ahead. may self
adjust compression ratios in specific bands based on levels of overall
frequency content for their normal usage in boosting levels for mastering
cd's. this came up on the motu list a while back and i don't remember if a
programmer from one of the commercial companies commented. as has been
pointed out, this stuff is proprietary and it probably wouldn't matter if i
did remember. and several searches on the internet have turned up squat on
these things.

having said all this, and yet still said nothing, i will say that a
multiband compressor opcode sounds like a great idea. it would be far more
powerful than dam and useful for sound mangling purposes far beyond the
"simple" utility i had in mind. limiting or compression is not in of itself
evil. if you build it i will use it. it's all i can do.

thank you,

I think I have missed something.  What is wanted more than is provided
by two calls to the scale program?  That seems easier that including
an opcode.  I must have misunderstood.

I see what you mean; but I worry that the audio quality will be much less than
what would be expected intuitively. If a filter has a gain of 30dB, which is
added or otherwise combined with existing material without normalizing it, that
will have the effect of pushing the previous material down by the same 30dB,
eventually descending below audibility into quantization noise (hence the need
for a maximiser, I suppose!).

In the worst case, the number cannot accomodate the addition, and will go
denormal, truncate, or whatever, which would lead to even greater distortion.

Of course, if the 'user' is a Csound user, they have control of this at every
stage (and the peak values in the header will add much to that control), but if
that user is a non-technical user of a GUI environment, they may have no control
at all, and will simply be surprised by what comes out of the DAC. 

I admit this is mostly theorizing on my part, as I always ensure everything I do
is within range; I suppose I will have to create some huge-ranged non-normalized
sounds and see what happens. It's good to have a tool like Csound which enbles
me to do just that, without hiding anything!

	I suppose not.  kbands would be the number of outputs - 1 (the 1 being the
rest of the spectrum).

	would kbands be necessary since number of outputs = kbands?

Let me chime in for that. 
optionally run the filtbank at krate and obtain rms of each band as output?

There has been a lot of discussion about maximizers, so I thought I would add
my thoughts.

	A maximizer is also called a band-specific compressor.  An input signal is
run through a filter bank first.  Then each band is separately compressed. 
Certain extraneous bands (above or below a certain freq, for instance) may be
removed or highly suppressed.  Then the signal is recombined.  The output then
is much more even-sounding (i.e. louder) than it probably was before.

	The algorithms for doing this are generally proprietary.  One example (that
we don't need to implement) is the Optimod by Orban.  This is designed for the
final compression stage of a radio broadcast, where there should be less that
5% (!!!) of difference between the loud passages and the quiet ones, so that
listeners in cars don't ever loose the signal.

	Mastering houses often use a less extreme version for CD's, so that it sounds
as loud as possible.  For those of us who sometimes don't want it to be as
loud as possible, you need to specifically request this.

	So where does csound stand in this?  It seems unlikely that any of us is
going to come up with an algorithm that is as good at doing this as your pro
plug-in of choice, like the Ultramaximizer.  These companies exist for the
sole purpose of doing this.  So my suggestion is that instead the focus should
be on a good filter bank opcode.  This is something that would be useful in a
number of situations.  It could look like:

a1 (... an), arest		filtbank	kbands, kbase, kspacing

where:
	kbands = the number of bands
	kbase = the top frequency of the first band
	kspacing = the width in octaves of each band
	a1...an = the output of each band
	arest = the remaining signal, delayed to be in sync with the bands

	Then each band could be manipulated separately and then recombined at will. 
With this, it would be easy to experiment with your own maximizer orchestra. 
This is not a trivial opcode, since designed the necessary filters is rather
tricky.  But there must be some research somewhere on how to do this.

The score language in Csound has evolved a little, with repeat
sections, overlapping sections, and so on.  If this is insufficient
for a particular use I usually find the a C program is my next step.
Flexible and adjustable and readily available on all my machines.

My God, Wavelet resynthesis in orchestra code...!!!
I wish we could have some wavelet analysis/resynthesis tool, similar to
that already implemented which uses Short-time fourier transforms
(pvoc).
Let me add I think we have now enough computer power to be able to call
the analysis routines from within the instrument code itself, so for
example, we could use multiple convolve files without having to
carefully prepare all the analysis files before (Im thinking of
implementing an orchestra-based HRTF convolver...), lots of other
possibilities btw...

A while ago, I volunteered to collect csound benchmarks made using the
piece "Xanadu" by Joseph Kung. This piece gives a more reasonable
workout for modern hardware than the old benchmarks did. I got a couple
of replies from folks on the list. I've now collected them into a web
page at:

http://members.tripod.com/~slinkP/pw_linux/csbench.html

Send me more benchmarks! So far I just have Robin Whittle's PPro 180, my
P133, several machines tested by jpff, and a P166 tested by Guto
Caminhoto. Macs are conspicuously absent.

A while back I was deep in studying Dolby Surround and AC3.  Here's a few
texts I found at Creative/Europe's site of all places, on AC-3 (which we
all know is far better than Dolby Surround anyway).  

http://www.cle.creaf.com/techknow/technology/dolby/ac-3mult.htm
**Has a great little graph at the bottom 

http://www.cle.creaf.com/techknow/technology/dolby/dolby.htm

Granted, these are basic documents, but give a good overview, history and a
little bit on the technical side.  I'm sure there are some better resources
out there, but I thought I might give a little input anyway.

I would LOVE to see CSound sucessfully implement this!

Hey cool, it worked!(once I plugged my midi cable in, oops). Now a few
questions: What would I need to do to to the sco file so that it'll recognize
modulation and 24semitone (2 octave) bend range data?. Also, what would I need
to do to tell it to receive all 16 channels in mono mode so that I can have
multiple instruments going at once? I'm sure all of this is in the manual
somewhere, but I just haven't gotten to it yet. I'm still learning how to make
my own orc files right now. Thanks for all the help.
Regards,
Jason

Subject: synthesizing with wavelet packets
Sender: owner-csound-outgoing@maths.ex.ac.uk
Precedence: bulk
Status:   


Hey there

I've been studying wavelets recently, a powerful tool for data compression, 
signal processing, denoising and multi-scale analysis. One interesting 
application of wavelets (more precisely a generalisation of wavelet methods, 
called wave packets) is the synthesis of "tonebursts", as it has been 
sugested by M.V. Wickerhauser (check 
http://www.amara.com/IEEEwave/IW_musicaltones.html). Without going into much 
detail, what he does is to apply the anti-convolution of the inverse wavelet 
transform, to a signal composed of a single 1 and the rest filled with 0s. 
The result is a toneburst, with various shapes, depending on the filters 
used, as well as their sequence (the specific packet).
Following Wickerhauser's method, I've been developing a series of 
instruments to take advantage of wave packet power. The following is a 
sized-down version of that not-yet-fully-debugged program, that just 
synthesizes a toneburst into a function table, and then lets you use it as 
any other table, for instance to be read by an oscilator.
I used a signal table of length 512 (must be a power of 2) and 
anti-convolved a wavelet of size 8. These dimensions can be changed, but may 
require tuning of the program. I sugest you experiment with the various 
filters, as well as the sequence by which they are applied, which is 
determined by a table of consecutive 0's and 1's (zero means apply the 
filter, 1 means apply the mirror filter).
The current settings correspond to the simplest filter, named DAUB4, the 
shortest of a class of FIR filters discovered by Daubechies, which generates 
a familiar shape (you'll see it in many wavelet papers), of some 
fancy-looking saw wave. As you use other filters (with bigger sizes), and 
change the order by which the filter and corresponding mirror filter are 
applied, the shapes increase in complexity. This generates all sorts of 
tonbebursts, and its worth to inspect them at close range, since the shapes 
are often interesting.
This is just one of the applications. In the full version I also follow 
another approach, of compressing a given sound file, for subsequent 
resynthesis using fewer data.
If you want to know more about wavelets, Amara's site above is a good 
introduction.

Btw, the ksmps=490 is used in the full program, which also applies the wave 
packet transform to a signal read from a sound file, using tablewa (it is 
the closest integer to 512, the table size). In this case you may change it

So here's the orchestra (dont forget to correct all wrapped around lines):

sr   =    44100
kr   =    90
ksmps     =    490

sorry for the rather lame question, but what is the difference between
the csound.exe file in csound_new.zip and csound_con.zip?  they both
have the same date and time, but the build in csound_con.zip is much
smaller.  also, what version is the most recent for these versions of
csound?
the reason i ask is because i have been using winsound, but i think i
want to switch to the command line version, but i am curious why
winsound sports a later version number and build date.

A MIDI note number is in Csounds terminology something like a pch (pitch) or oct.
The middle c on a keyboard (note number 60) equals to 8.00 in Csound, one
octave lower is 48 in MIDI and 7.00 in Csound, 36 is 6.00 and so on. Therefore
you have to divide the MIDI number by 12 to get Csound octs. The lowest MIDI
note number is 0, that is 5 octaves below 60 and 3.00 in Csound. This gives us
the formula for transforming MIDI to oct:

oct(MIDI) = MIDI/12.0 + 3.0

The conversion to Hertz can be done by cpsoct ("make cps from oct").
If p4 contains the MIDI note number you can write:

icps = cpsoct(p4/12.0 + 3.0)

If you want to convert MIDI to pch you have to take into account that pch is
not a normal decimal number but two numbers pasted together by a dot: 
octave and two digits for semitones above that octave  (8.09 is a4, 8.9 is 90
semitones higher than c4)

pch(MIDI) = int(MIDI/12.0) + (MIDI - int(MIDI/12.0)) / 10.0


Hope this helps

Your comments about Common Music piqued my curiosity. How is Common Music
available? I have a PowerMac, for instance: do I need a separate Lisp compiler?
Is there such a thing for Mac? How much do I have to know about Lisp (meaning
what I know now is nothing)?

Since everybody is doing that, I'll throw in another bit. Ever heard
of nyquist: fully object oriented, behavioral abstraction of instruments
(i.e. a glissando behaves with rules defined in a given instrument
and differently in another instrument), full communication between
score and orchestra (as a matter of fact there's very little distinction
on it), etc. etc. etc. Coded efficiently, and a lisp-like interpreter
that resembles CM. Obviously free (cela va sans dire).
What do you want more?

 Hope this might be of use to csound users.

I wrote a command line 'vu' meter.  You
send an audio sample stream through its
standard in and out, while it displays a
nice graph of the amplitude, warning about
clipping.

It is great for recording, or monitoring the
max amp in a pipe:

	record | vu > foo.wav
or
	record | vu | csound -istdin ...

vu understands wave files, and can be instructed
to use raw or other formats on the command line.

Here is some sample standard error output:

WAVE file: 16 bits per sample, Mono

Any or all of the columns can be turned off, so for example just
the raw amplitude can be output, or saved to a file.  Graph can
be updated at any rate, down to 1 per sample frame.

Package contains source and linux ELF binary.  Should compile on
any UNIX.  Don't know about others.  stderr exist on others?

Hi, has anyone tried to encode dolby-surround sounds using csound, or in any
other ways?
I have 3 questions regarding this:

When encoding the surround channel, do you HAVE to phase-shift (+90/-90), or
is it equal to doing (0/-180)?
And do you have to use the Band pass filter when encoding the surround
channel? I guess every decent dolby-decoder uses a LP-filter for that channel
anyway.
Do you HAVE to use some dolby noise-reduction for the surround channel? When
using 100% digitally generated music (noise? ;), to deliver 100% digitally,
this would be obsolete, i guess.

hi edward,
	you can use listing file to save output.. (you will still see
output as well) adding cut/copy will be harder than normal..

Hi,

I used some sequencer instruments in tekbbl.orc, sco available from
http://www.werewolf.net/~hljmm/csound/  My TB3030 emulator is available
there also although I think it has some quirky bugs.

<x-rich>ok i'm spammin you guys again with my preliminary findings regarding
maximizer and feature request. if i'm annoying anyone please let me
know and i'll take you off my cc list next time i get an itch.


conclusion first: any handy dandy maximizer opcode for csound or
elsewhere would benefit from arguments to indicate time to begin within
soundfile and time to end in addition to ratio, threshold and response
time. portions of soundfile before and after would remain completely
untouched and intact.


went back to past csounder discussion of this topic just to confirm
that this issue is driving others nuts beside myself -and that no real
solution was posted. so an opcode request is looking more reasonable
all the time. the holy grail here is a quick level fix that avoids that
limiter/compressor sound. that is to say, a limiter that limits
intelligently coupled with an expander that expands intelligently. i
think. yes -psychoacoustics. suggest that any such opcode be tested by
many with diverse musical tastes and tasks. maybe (shudder) even
different settings for voice, rock, percussion, bright, dull, fat,
thin, electroacoustic (hah) or whatever.


what i forgot was that what may be the industry standard for dealing
with this is the Waves L1 Ultramaximizer at www.waves.com. there are
people out there who swear that once you try it you will never
normalize again. believe available for mac, windows and various plug-in
architectures. problem here, and elsewhere, is that you are forced to
buy this huge package (list price $500) with a zillion other things you
may not want.


also the case with Soundworx
<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>http://www.prosoniq.com/</fontfamily>.
downloaded their complete demo package and was very happy with a sound
of particular concern, though being percussive the test was hardly
exhaustive. csound dam will probably do quite nicely here. and
incidentally, prosoniq sonicWORX Artist Basic is a nice little
freeware editing package.


possibly a plug-in for SoundMaker
<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><<http://www.micromat.com/micromat/soundmaker/soundmaker.html>
</fontfamily>(pkg around $70) but who knows? not much detail to be
found on their site.


everything else i looked at appeared to be merely a compressor limiter.
so how about it? maximizer opcode anyone?


thanks for listening,

tolve

Im also intrigued about it. I think all you know about the subject could be
useful for me... apart from the doc. cited in the Csound help file when talking
about GEN13&14 from Palamin&palamin I dont know other sources of info. It is a
phantom gen routine, Ive never seen it used in practice, and Im Csounding for
5 years...
What is PHASE-QUADRATURE WAVESHAPING? ;-)

I think the strong point of Csound is that it is NOT object-oriented. 
You do not want to have to deal with the higher-level concepts of
someone else telling you what an instrument is supposed to be.  For
Csound the result seems to be an active community of users and regular
additions of new opcodes from among those users.  And, like someone
remarked, even if it is like assembler, what's wrong with that?  It is
nice to have a language in which you can tweak things without being
bothered by classes or what have you.

My main complaint would be about the score language, which seems to view
a score is a series of events ordered in time.  Some MIDI sequencers let
you do interesting things with repeating patterns, which could be of
different length (Logic Notator lets you do that, for example).  Have
others felt those limitations and found a solution?

The version of Midi to CSound has no version number but it has a modified 
date of June 3 1992. As for your crash, did you try increasing the memory 
partition?

I am running on system 7.6.1. It seems to run fine. The Csound version is 
the release that comes with 3.485 which was only released in the last 
week or two.

What is crashing CSound or  Midi to Csound? I run Midi to CSound as a 
separate app. So, I'm not sure how the crash could be attributable to 
CSound (or is there a way to get CSound to output a .sco from a midi 
file?)

When you used it, how did you convert the note numbers to pitches that 
CSound understands.

Csound 3.485 (mac) is not recognizing the *igauss* opcode I am using in my

And another thing, is their a manual for all available opcodes for 3.485

Sometimes when I use GEN 05 as a grain envelope with the score generator,
an annoying popping sound is produced.  Are there any known issues

At first you have to assign instrument numbers to MIDI channels (see MIDI in
the menue).
If your instrument(s) have additional params (p4, p5, p6, p7) you can map one
MIDI message or byte to each pfield. 

Another possible problem applies to the midi file formats (0,1,2). I think
that MIDIToCsound supports only format 0 and 1 (one multichannel track or
simultaneous tracks).

OK. So, the problem I was having with MidiToCSound was that it doesn't 
output the pitch by default.

Now that I've got that working, I have a new question. MidiToCSound 
expresses the pitch as the midi note number. Is there a pitch converter 
that will take a midi note number value and convert it to cps, pch or oct 
format?

As far as I can tell cpsmidi and cpsmidib only work for realtime stuff. I 
tried:

icps = cpsmidi(p4)

That doesn't work. Is there a pitch converter function that will do this? 
(I'm using the latest CSound for PPC from Mills).

Here is a sample of what midiToCsound puts out

i 1 0.000 0.237 48
i 1 0.000 0.237 72
i 1 0.250 0.237 55
i 1 0.250 0.237 63


Thanks,

Hi,

I'm not sure whether this is considered good form or not, so I apologize
beforehand if it is.

The MIT Press will have an exhibit at ICMC, so please stop by if you'd like
to look through Foundations of Computer Music or any of the other Computer
Music books published by The MIT Press. We'll also have the draft
manuscript of The Csound Book, edited by Richard Boulanger, on hand.

I agree that SAOL is probably the closest to what you are describing, though I
suspect it's still a way from being an object-oriented language in terms of such
things as inheritance and polymorphism. Smalltalk is another obvious language,
which is fairly widely used for computer music. None of these is Csound however,
which is expressly a 'low-level' language, indeed emulating assembler...

...which is of course still very much being used! There are also plenty
advocating FORTH as a language for computer music - compact, expressive,
powerful, but not object-oriented. Appropriateness for the task seems to end up
being much more important to composers than how old or fashionable the language
is. 

In OOP, the emphasis tends to be on the management of medium to large projects,
in which months, if not years, may be spent on design, before any code is even
written (well, that's the theory, anyway). Most Csound instruments and
orchestras tend to be, by programming standards, fairly small objects, developed
incrementally, for which a full object-oriented language is arguably overkill. 

At the compositional level, where abstractions are particularly important, OOP
and functional languages (Smalltalk, lisp,nyquist etc) are widely used. The
output from these might well be a Csound orchestra and score - Csound represents
a viable low-level language for this task, while still being (relatively)
readable. 

I am not up to date with the literature, but my impression is that a wide
variety of custom 'front-ends' or preprocessors have been designed, to create
both instruments and scores (though the emphasis has tended towards the latter).
And I think Jean_Claude Risset still uses MUSIC-V!

This would be perhaps even less object-oriented than Csound! If the score is a
member of the instrument, strictly speaking it would be 'private'; at the very
least, the coupling between the instrument and the score will be very tight,
which is one of the things OOP programming strives to avoid - change the format
of the score, and all the instruments have to be changed too. Rather, the score
'object' would send the instrument a message 'play this' - which, funnily
enough, is more-or-less what happens already. There is coupling, of course - the
pfields are in effect the 'public' variables of the instrument, so that it is
all but impossible for all scores to be playable by all instruments. Csound
composers rely on this low-level control and compact notation. 

However, the design of languages for synthesis and composition is still a huge
research topic; there is plenty of room for new ideas, and if you can put more
detail to yours, there may well be programmers on this list, and elsewhere, who
would be interested to implement them.

If Csound is like assembler, then I
revere it as the LCD that provides a portal from the
ubiquitous limitations of 'higher level' sound specification
schemes, into a blissful arena where the composer finally
stands before the challenge of creation unencumbered, and
fully armed.

See how the C language is put into assembler code before it 
is made executable. The Csound score and orchestra syntax 
are both well suited to front end generation.  I often make
simple shell scripts that, given parameters, quickly generate
and execute a csound orc and score pair, giving me a higher
level of control in sound processing.  The Spartan nature of
the code facilitates this nicely.

Sure:
A good tutorial article was C. Roads 'ATutorial on non-linear Distortion or
Waveshaping synthesis' CMJ 3(3):29-34 1979.,
reprinted in Foundations of Computer Music,MIT Press 1985.
The classic early writer on waveshaping wasJames Beauchamp, try
'Brass tone Synthesis by Spectrum Evolution Matching with Non-linear
functions'
CMJ  3(2):35-43 1979, also repinted Foundations of Computer Music..
and the best technical treatment I know of was Marc LeBrun 'Digital
Waveshaping Synthesis',
Journal of the Audio Engineering Society 27(4):250-266, 1979

I presume you mean the souce code, not the orc/score syntax?

I think it depends on how inportant 'fashion' is. I am writing some simple dsp
routines (quasi-opcodes) in C++ because it is easy and convenient - I can plug
bits together very quickly. However, I am under no illusions that the result
runs particularly efficiently. Despite the style of its code (which is
continually being improved, anyway) Csound runs remarkably quickly - witness the
number of users who get it to work in real-time.

There are also some platforms, such as the Atari (still very much in use!) for
which C++ is not available, and one of the most important aspects of Csound is
that the core code will compile and run on just about any platform which
supports a C compiler.

Also, from all the books I have read, a surface revamp of this sort of C code
into C++ does not usually work well, and can even introduce more problem than it
solves. A good idiomatic C++ version of Csound would almost certainly have to be
written from scratch. Although C++ has now been 'standardized' there are still
areas of uncertainty, and significant differences between implementations, which
could lead to portability problems.

Actually, there is a bit of C++ code in Csound - in the GUI part of Winsound. It
currently sits in a rather uneasy relationship with the more unix-ish parts of
the code, but it is there. And ironically, some code (the physical modelling
opcodes) has been converted from C++ to C!

It is an interesting idea, nevertheless, and if someone came up with a
base-class definitition for an opcode (complete with krate and arate methods) I
would be very glad to try it out!

Hello all !  

I've made a sound that I like A LOT, but I don't know what to do
next.....The orc and sco are included, so check it out.
Try to run it in realtime with Maldonado's DXCsound 2.1, as there are
opcodes used only supported by DXCsound...

- Can anyone comment this sound and make suggestions what could be done for
making it more interesting ??

- Is there a way to "morph" between two function tables ????

Does anyone out there use the Mac program "MidiToCsound"?

I'm finding that it's output doesn't work (the durations come out funky 
and there are no instrument numbers). I'm wondering if there is a trick.

Thanks,

Dear all,

I have been listening to this list for a couple of months now. I've
been playing with CSound and I obtained some interesting results.
However, I still have a couple of questions.

1. Is it possible, on NT 4.0, to read from a MIDI device (using the -M
option). In other words is there a /dev/midi equivalent on NT ?

2. Can I, again on NT, send the output of CSound straight to the sound
processor in stead of first to a WAV file ?

Thanks.


Koen Dejonghe

Dear all,

As a developer who programs in a variety of languages, I am baffled by
the old fashioned way of writing CSound. It is very powerfull indeed,
but so is Assembler. It is also very cumbersome to get even the least
of sounds working. (I know I'm kicking some people's shins right now.)

Is anybody working on a higher level version of CSound ? Can we expect
a C++Sound in the future ?

Thanks for reading and responding.

Kind regards,
Koen Dejonghe

Just Curious,

Is the following example supposed to actually work, or is it showing the basic
syntax? I saved the files as sco/orc files and executed them. When I played a
note on my keyboard, there was no sound. Csound acted like it wanted to play
something, but didn't.
Thanks,
Jason

I don't think there has ever been any 'standard' for pvoc files, at least as far
as the header is concerned. In CDP we use WAV and AIF, with a lot of extra
information put in proprietary chunks. Unix machines may use the snd format, or
no header at all, or IRCAM. Word ordering will also be machine-specific. So the
chances of a given pvoc file being portable are fairly slim.

However, if you know the pvoc parameters which created the file, and can hack
past the header (or lack of it), you should be able to recover the data, which
will always (as far as I know..) be interleaved amplitude/frequency for each
channel, for each successive anaylsis bin.

This is one of the reasons for the CNMAT SDIF initiative, which will eventually
provide a fully portable file format not only for pvoc data, but a lot else
besides.

I use version 3.482 of Csound (csound.exe), which is from June 2, 1998,
I haven't upgraded yet to a newer version.

The parameters I use (as shown by Visorc) are:

	-oC:\CSOUND\TOOLS\VISORC\wav\test.wav  -W

in which C:\CSOUND\TOOLS\VISORC\ is my Visorc install directory.  

For realtime output, I use:

	-odevaudio -W

These are the minimum parameters you need.  I haven't experimented with
other real-time features.

Another setting to look at is the sample rate.  Not all that you can
choose from may work for your sound card.  Values that do work for me,
are 11025, 22050, 44100, and 48000.  You will have to adjust the control
rate so that sample_rate/control_rate is an integer.  E.g., you can use
sr = 22050 and kr = 441.

To see what is going on, you can have Csound write a log file.  You
would enter "-- test.log" (without quotes) in the Other flags field of
the Command Line options of Visorc, which would write the log file
test.log in the Visorc directory.

Hope this helps some more.

Is anyone successfully using either of the Linux ports of Paul Lansky's
"rt" mixer? There are two ports listed on Dave Phillips' soundapps page:
http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/linux_soundapps.html

One is an ELF binary compiled by Michael Petersen, which on my system
simply gives a floating point exception and then goes away. It's at
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~michael/rt.html

The other is a source package from Guenter Geiger which I haven't been
able to compile (yet). I think I need to track down the ViewKit stuff.
Anyway, this port was at ftp://iem.mhsg.ac.at/rt/ but the server's not
responding now...

Sorry for blabbing this on several mailing lists. **PLEASE** direct
replies to me, and watch out for that Cc: list. Let's not clutter three
mailing lists with this thread. If I get it working, I promise to post
details on my web site:

I've experienced much the same problem. I got in touch with the author
but unfortunately he couldn't figure it out either! 
I just gave up which is a pity since it LOOKS pretty good.
Have you tried "Virtual Waves"? It isn't Csound but does lots of high
quality signal generation and processing with an elegant front end.
Type "Synoptic" in your search engine.
Cheers

There are 2 types of Csound Instruments: Score-Activated Instruments and
Midi-Activated Instruments. You must have some care in dealing with
Score Activated Instruments. The following opcodes CANNOT be used in
Score-activated Instrumets otherwise Csound will crash:

notnum, veloc, cpsmidi, cpsmidib, cpsmidib, octmidi, octmidib, octmidib,
pchmidi, pchmidib, pchmidib, ampmidi, aftouch, chpress, pchbend,
midictrl, midictrl, midictrlsc, imidic7, midic7, imidic14, midic14,
imidic21, midic21

The following midi-oriented opcodes can be used both in Score-Activated
Instruments and Midi-Activated Instruments without any problem:

ictrl7, ctrl7, ictrl14, ctrl14, ictrl21, ctrl21, chanctrl, chanctrl,
initc7, initc14, initc21, slider8, slider16, slider8f, slider16f,
islider8, islider16

This turned out to be a problem with our local version compiled
under Linux which I've fixed.

Look at the guitar distortion orchestra from Mikelson.  Some nice
sounds, and not too much processing power.
  If you need a copy I still have it somewhere (on the laptop)

Antoine,

    Try  "The computer music tutorial" by Curtis Roads (MIT press).
    It's a book that covers "everything" (in a sense) and lets you in on most
synthesis an modulation
    techniques plus all the basic digital-audio
concepts,programming,MIDI,psychoacoustics,sound
    analysis and more.

    It's really thick and makes you come back to it quite often.

I'll be getting back to work soon on convovle and pvoc units that do the
analysis from within the instrument. The pvoc works already in my version,
the convolve might be done in a month or so.

	your right, but again i was thinking from a user point of view.
It is the process' problem for handling overflow - but it shouldnt matter
to the user one bit-as long as it spits out a float file containing the
proper peak value- think of this as "never" normalizing or "always"
normalizing its the same thing

	(this kind of spills over from the music-dsp discussion on AIFF-C
and WAV format for floating pt files).  I guess what i was trying to say
in my previous comment about "hoping that EVERYONE uses floats ALWAYS" was
that i hope floatingpt w/ peak value stored becomes a standard use - and
every application just knows to handle the data with the peak value ALWAYS
(in fact soundin/diskin/loscil/gen1 should have options to either
autmatically normalize to peak value in AIFF-C/WAV float or someway to
return that value inside an orc)
- whether that means doing the divide to "normalize" while processing or
whatever - this will save on calculation times as normalizing always has
to do be done as post-process--so should just wait till it is
needed(during next process/playback) then immediately after..

What, never? I see a few problems with this:

you will need to normalize the data in order to play it on a real-world sound
card - and be limited by that card's resolution;

A floating-point number does not have unlimited precision (especially the 32bit
variety), so it is not too hard to make Csound create numbers that are
pathologically small or huge. I have recently found a hitherto dormant bug in
the standard implementation of the phase vocoder - in the resynthesis, floats
are used to store the accumulating instantaneous frequency of each bin.
Eventually the numbers get too big, and overflow, and the audio progressively
distorts. Depending on the system, this may happen after about 15minutes of
performance, or later - but it will happen. By changing the calculation to keep
the value wrapped around (dare I say it, 'normalized' to) 2*PI (as is done in
the analysis stage), the problem disappears.

The range of amplitudes becomes crucial when any non-linear processing is
carried out on the signal. For example,  when squaring a sample, or otherwise
raising it to a power, with normalized values (+- 1) the result will always
remain normalized. As soon as values exceed 1, amplitudes can grow without bound
(this is the basis of the 'nlfilt' opcode, for example). Such processing is by
no means esoteric: taking the square root (then restoring the sign of the
original afterwards) boosts low amplitudes in relation to high ones - if applied
to the normalized amplitude envelope, a possible basis for a 'maximizer'. 

A floating-point number is really little more than a bigger saucepan - it can
still boil over.

So, let it be 'hardly ever...' instead.

Although, I am not sure, I believe it is Left=0 Right=+180(or -180).

Decoders filter and delay the surround channel. Most can also do other
things to the surround like EQ, mangle it with some sort of pseudo-stereo,
and/or add multitap delays or reverb. Just depends on the manufacturer and
what they think will sell.

It is in the format (encode/decode hardware). It is Dolby B, so is not *too*
obtrusive. Anyway, it is to overcome noisy distribution sources (VHS tape,
etc.).

If you really want the Dolby Surround format, output your four discrete
channels (L/C/R/S) from Csound, then encode it with Dolby hardware or
software such as the Pro-Tools plug-in.

In typical Dolby Surround mixing, the material is mixed to 4 discrete
channels - Left/Center/Right/Surround. This 4 channel mix is fed to the
Dolby Surround Encoder which does the matrixing. I do not know the exact
nature of the phase shifting. BTW, Dolby Surround is a trademark, and, at
least some of the technology is proprietary. Much more information available
at http://www.dolby.com

Hope this helps.

Get CM from:

ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/Lisp/cm

You can chose to get binaries for Mac, SGI, LINUX, Win95 if you don't have
your own lisp compiler. The documentation is very extensive, but there's
not for how to use it with Csound. I will have a lot of my Computer Music
course materials available on line for my students this year and will
include a number of examples at the "beginner" level in using CM for
making csound note lists. I could make these publically available but I
would not have the time to answer questions about them. 

There are tutuorials available in the documentation. Of course it would
help to know some lisp already, or at least to have some programming
experience if you're going to teach yourself CM (most of my students have
no prior lisp experience and learn to become quite good at programming
according to the needs of their music, but they're not having to teach
themselves).

thanks for your response matt. your floating point point is well taken.

when i refer to intelligence for maximize opcode (compressor/limiter), i
mean that it would have in it built in criteria as to which frequency bands
to boost or cut and by how much based on the content of the file. i think.
expect that here again sones come into play.

maximize opcode should probably also have built in filters to eliminate
frequencies above and below the range of human hearing to avoid files being
maxed out by such frequency content.

the primary use in mind for a maximize opcode would be for files that are
already normalized or floating pointed and still somehow do not sound loud
enough. personally don't have a clue as to the specific inner workings of
such devices but the sonicworx version does seem to do the job. level of a
file maxed out in volume is appreciably increased with, compared to
compressor/limiters, little change in timbre -at least to my ears. in fact
it allows for huge increases but i didn't have much succes with preserving
timbre with anything more than double. which was plenty!

though already do-able in csound with filters and gain, a maximize opcode
would be a far faster way of dealing with large files to boost the overall
perceived volume, even of an entire mix -and maximizers appear to be in
wide use for mastering CD's despite the fact that most popular music is of
limited dynamic range.

For MacOS people, check out Bol Processor 2. It allows the creation of
non-fixed sound objects (time can vary and scale the events accordingly to
match) within CSound score output.
      I use the program quite a bit. Normally I create an SMF of the drum
pattern I want to use, import it as a sound object, map the MIDI parameters
onto p-fields, create a grammar which modifies the duration of the object
library, and let it rock out. Instant weird-step Drum&Bass!

There are other applications which aren't quite as frivilous....

Rick Taube's Lisp-based Common Music is the absolute best event
processor/score language around. It's a quite remarkable achievement. 
Anyone using Csound who wants a high-level programming language for making
scores should take the time to learn it. Common Music can output csound
note lists, midifiles, and a number of other formats for other synthesis
and sound processing programs (CLM, CMix, RT...). It's great as a tool for
composing "acoustic" music as well if you're into using computers as an
aid to composition in general.

It's too early for me to say if it's a "solution" yet, at least for me,
but I'm very optimistic about a score-manipulating "language" I've just
started developing in Perl. Perl seems born for the task of manipulating
csound files-- after all, they're just plain text!

When I get something usable & interesting to work, I'll announce it on

but it'll be released under the GNU public license, so that shouldn't be
a problem. :)

Last month, I tried using convolution for reverb for the first time. I
used an impulse sample from Howard Fredericks's site
(http://wwwvms.utexas.edu/~fredrics/isrc.html - I used the Domkyrkan
sample). The results were quite beautiful - certainly so in comparison to
sending sharp-edged sounds through nrev. I attained a wonderfully long,
perfectly clear reverb tail. 

I haven't used convolution for a complete piece yet, but the downsides
I have seen thus far are: it takes significantly
longer to compute and you don't have the kind of control over reverb
character that you do through conventional reverbs - unless you
dynamically choose different impulse files. Handling the
delay correctly is an additional burden. 

Since I work through Common Music to make my sco files, I've setup my
Csound instruments and Common Music object-types so I can do all of my
rough work using nrev and then quickly swap to convolution for my final
product.

Have a look at CLM (Common Lisp Music).

Try looking at SAOL which is rather like Csoudn with structure.

Richard,

I am sorry if I was unclear. I really meant the orc/sco code. I have
not seen the source code to build CSound yet, I downloaded a
pre-compiled version, and I'm (almost) happy with it. 

The first time I saw CSound "programs" (read orc/sco files) I couldn't
help thinking that this looked a lot like the assembly language used a
thousand years ago.

What I meant was that an object-oriented version of the CSound
language would be great. Imagine base classes of instruments (the
score being a member of the instrument) that you can re-use,
inheriting all of its components, but adding or changing some
parameters here and there (e.g. the score). I have no idea what it
would look like, I only have a strong gut feeling that the language of
CSound could do with a major revamp.

I'm just brainstorming right now: first the new language would have to
be designed, based on object-oriented design principles. Then, in a
first phase) a preprocessor built which translates the new language
into CSound orc/sco's (maybe in Perl). Then you invoke the CSound
compiler. Later the preprocessor and the compiler could be integrated
into one program.

No, it will not improve the speed. And of course, I don't have the
time to do it myself, and even if I had it, I'm afraid I'm not smart
enough.

My realtime version is tested on win95 with directX 3.0 with
SoundBlaster cards. Maybe it run also on WinNT. Please, inform me if it
operates well also on WinNT.

You can get it at the following URLs:

(read carefully the readme file. This version has several differences

I absolutely must agree hear that if someone wants a "sequencer" for Csound
you have to check out Common Music.  Though the learning curve is steep like
Csound, and there is a lack of much documentation, it is worth it.  As open
ended and vast as Csound.

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could help with this.
I'm trying to figure out the best way to create an instrument
that will give me a specific output waveform.  For example
something like the following (in ascii "graphics", this will
probably look awful if it's not displayed with a courier font):

        _________
       |         |
       |         |
       |         |
       |         |____________________________________

time:  0         1us                    (remaining 0 to 2ms)

or perhaps more generally (amplitude of 1):

        _________          _______
       |         |        /       \
       |         |       /         \
       |         |      /           \
       |         |_____/             \_________

       |         |     |   |      |   |        |
time: t0         t1    t2  t3     t4  t5       t6

I want to send out one of these (above waveforms) repeatedly every,
say, X milliseconds.  I'm trying to model a hardware sound sound
generator that would do this.

Is there an easy way to do this in a csound orchestra? Or does anybody
have a good idea of how to approach this?

Part of the problem appears to be the mapping of time against table
locations, when trying to specify this in a function statement with
a gen7.  I've also looked at phasor, but I don't think that will do
it either.

Does anyone have any ideas on this?

Cheers,
Paul

I do not agree.  linepos is set to -1 after a newline (line 165) so it
is zero when the # is read.  There may be an error in that the initial
value is set to 0 rather than -1 on line 86

Hi all,

In Csounder version 3.3 in the preferences dialog you can
set it to use a MIDI file.  However, in the main screen of
Csounder you have to have both an .orc and .sco file selected
before you can compile.  The problem is that the wav file which
is output contains note data from both the .sco file and the MIDI
file.  How do I set it so that I hear only MIDI file note data?
Is there a way to bypass the .sco file?

Thank you,
Wayne

with a sample rate of 44,100
a stereo file...
a small request..
and send me a url with some tutorials that work well and explain on
Csound on a basic level.

Hi,

A while ago a posted a short introduction to Csound targeted at the complete
beginner.  I have created a web page from this message.  It is available at
the following web site:

http://www.werewolf.net/~hljmm/csound/articles/intro.html

I thought this might be useful for some of the new people on the list.

Hello, me again,

    I can't seem to find version 3.47 of Csound for my PowerMac/PPC, any
ideas where? Or what is the scoop on the platforms version? I would
really like to get some of the new opcodes!

Thanks,

Hello,

    We all know that the Ftable .....10 1 = a sine wave and I know the
square, and saw numbers, but does any one have or know of the correct
book, or www site that has a LARGE variety of these numbers?

i.e. approximations of; a trumpet, white noise, violin, distorted
guitar???

Thank you fellow Csounders,
Marcus

Hi!

On the Preferences window, you have two text boxes inside a frame
titled "Process with". The first (labeled as "CSound"), serves only to
specify a Csound DOS Protected Mode executable (in example, the 3.485
version form MIT). CS Visual will attempt to execute any EXE declared
here under protected mode, although being a Win32 program (I think
this is what must be occuring).
In the other text box (labeled as "RT Csound") you should put the
Direct CSound path or any other Win32 EXE. Unfortunately, CS Visual
will not appropiately run Direct CSound because some flags differ from
the RT ones. 
We did not have time to test Direct CSound, and for this reason no
support is provided in the current version of the shell... I see this
can be a big limitation. We will include as soon as posible support
for Direct CS.
Please let us know any other suggestion or bug, and thanks to try the
program!

Regards.

Sorry, I forgot this in my previouse reply.

Does the SoundBlaster full-duplex problem also explain the "buffering"
effect (can't find a better
  word with my english), or just the bad quality I get when suound MANAGES
to get through.

Thnx again.

That's it, unfortunately. Sound Blaster AW64 Gold.I really wanted it to be
my fault but I guess I will now nedd to get a new card or just ANOTHER.

Hi all.

If you're still interested on testing our CSound shell, its english
version is ready to be downloaded.
Only one "oops": while the complete program interface was written on
english, the code was compiled using the Visual Basic 5.0 Spanish
Edition. Consequently, the Setup utility provided for install the
program, it's on spanish too... Anyway, there are a few steps to
follow. The files are ZIPped on a single archive (about 4 MB). If you
have some problem to install it, please email us.

Thanks a lot, and regards!

You should be aware of these questions:
1) is your computer fast enough to handle real-time?
2) is the buffer length ('-b' flag) set to a sufficient dimension (at
least 500 when using in and out simultaneously)?
3) is the number of buffers ('-p' flag) big enough (at least 4)?
5) are you using a 'rounded' sr (for example 40000 Hz or 32000 Hz with
'-e' flag)?
6) are you using a Sound Blaster (the soundBlasters wave-in resolution
is reduced to 8-bit  when using full-duplex, but these cards are the
only I successfully tested. I have two soundblaster in my computer to
avoid the 8-bit problem).

good luck!

Hello all,

I have just recently installed MkLinux on my Mac.  I wanted to run
CSound in my new OS and perhaps compare its performance between
different OS's on the same platform.  However I haven't been able to
install/compile csound successfully.

Has anyone here tried to run it on MkLinux?

Mike

Just tried using the latest Visual Orchestra with the latest DirectCSound
from Gabriel.  It appears the flag formats have changed, so VisOrc generates
flags DirectCSound won't use.  Anyone know a way around this?  Has the
writer of VisOrc been made aware?

Second, and more important problem:  if any paths or filenames include
spaces under W95/98/NT, VisOrc doesn't enclose them in quotes, and they
appear to DirectCSound as too many arguments.  Again, any way around this?
Thanks.

Hi,

    I'm having trouble using the '-i' flag in RT1.9 .
    The sound coming in (from mic or line) to Csound,when outputed, is
extremely noisy
    and seem to be "buffered" (?!?  maybe the wrong word but it sound
like that) and by
    experimentations, I think I reduced the problem to the '-i' flag
[allowing real-time audio in].

    I double-checked it using the "delay.orc/sco" example.

    Naturally, I checked the buffer size and ar/kr rates but the problem
persists.

    Is this a known problem ? Did I miss anything obviouse ?

                        H....E....L....P....

Hello ! 
I' m  working on C_sound Version 3.485 (30 Aug 1998)  on a Dos Pc Pentium.
Is  there probably a  bug in the f statement part of  this new release ?
It  seeem to me that  it is unable to see the gen number and it doubles the
size of table.

Thank You for any suggestion.
Bye

What deriver trick? I don't understand. Normally each MIDI channel is
assigned to the sameinstrument number, if it is found. So if you want to
use, for example, MIDI chan 1 and 2, you must write an orchestra
containing instr1 and instr2.

Yes it is normal. Actually MIDI controllers above 90 are specialized in
other obscure function (I suppose to follow the General Standard, which
I don't like). I removed all the specialized code in DirectCsound 2.0 so
you should use all 127 controllers. The control #64 is still dedicated
to SUSTAIN PEDAL, so I strongly recommend to not use it for other
purposes.

Hi all,
    I'm working on building some sampling orcs, and was wondering if someone
could explain how to implement a release/decay segment for a looping sample
for "x" number of seconds using Csound scoring format (not midi).
Thanks for any suggestions,

BATch files are text files. You can create them using the commands found by
typing Help<enter> in a DOS window (assumes you installed the dos help with
Windows - i've heard recent versions don't do this by default).
There is one example halfway through my getting started html page, which you 
can find at
http://hem.passagen.se/rasmuse/Csound.htm (the actual page is called PCinstal.htm)

Did you get Winsound? It's in the csound_win.zip file in directory "/newest" on the 
Bath/Montreal servers.

All of the binaries are from v3.485  I generated the file

I found it.  I wasn't specifying the type for
the *output* file.  The error was a bit misleading.
Might have been "unknown output format" rather than
"unknown sound format".

It seems to work now, thanks.

Dear Csounders

I found a problem with PVOC analysis:
when I analyse some signal with a, say, 4096 frame size, everything goes
well but, doing resynthesis, Csound (<=3.47 on NT, at least) complains
about the window size being > 1024. Again analysis/resynthesis with
framesize <= 1024 goes well, but sometimes I would prefer a larger
window - am I the only one?

Maybe some idea to change this in a later Csound version???

regards, lex vanderwal

Hi,
	I have to admit that this list (and much of the CSound docs) is way over my
level, so, is there a better place for me to discuss some of the more basic
questions about CSound? Perhaps some info on the underlying principals of
synthesizers in general and how they relate to CSound.

How does one use the formant value table in the back of the CSound manual?
The manual at various points says that multiple fov commands are needed,
so I suspect that the table details correct values for the separate
commands, so if someone could tell me how they're used...

Thanks.

Let me add a question related to Pvoc analysis stage: is there an upper
limit for the overlap factor? Is it arbitrary or related to other parameters
(frame size?) of the analysis? I never could get an overlap factor of 16...

Hi CSlist,

Did Gabriel make this publicly available somewhere ? I'd be curious to
have a look at it, if only to try to fix it in order to work with my 
Turtle Beach Tahiti card (although this one has DirectX drivers, it 
doesn't seem to work - however it works fine with my other card, a SB
clone).

Regards,

P.T.

This is really just for background;

Is this writing the new Microsoft type-3 (floats) file? I added the code in
Csound (PC) to support Type-3. This format nominally requires data to be
normalized; I made an (I think reasonable) 'executive decision' to assume that
people wanted compatibility with conventional scores which write to +- 32767 (to
do anything more flexible would need an extra flag, and there are a lot of these
already...). Amplitudes in this range will come out correctly normalized in
Type-3. A larger range will generate overflowed values in the WAVE file, which
are allowed by the format, 'and must be bound by the rendering device'.

Dear Reader of the Csound List,

I am happy to announce that:

The Csound Book is in production at MIT Press!  They will be showing the
pre-production version of the text at the Internation Computer Music
Conference this week.  I am sorry that it took me so long to get it to this
point but it turned out to be a larger than HUGE project.  As you all know,
Csound is a moving target.  And it practically killed me this past spring.
(In fact, my brain was bleeding and shifting shift and I ended up having
heart surgery. But I miraculously survived and managed to finish it  - with
a lot of help and prayers.)

So... after a summer of completely revising the text, correcting all the
figures and debugging all the instuments and code. (With the assistance of
John ffitch  (he lived at my place on weekends during the months of July
and August and Matt Ingals (over the internet) plus the slave labor of a
dedicated group of student assistants including Bobby Pietrusko, Samara
Krugman and Jacob Joaquin (all of whom lived with me for weeks at a time),
the final manuscript was delivered to MIT Press on August 25. (Doug Sery
actually drove to my home to pick it up because I could barely stand on my
feet.)

At the Press, they took a month to read it and gave it the go ahead last
friday (September 25).  They are fast-tracking the production and
publication there, which means I will be called upon for a final read/edit
in a week or so before they begin laying it out.  But it is in the works
now and will soon be in your hands.

So... The 800+ page textbook will include a full and newly revised and
edited reference manual plus 2 CD-ROMS. It will be available in May/June
1999.  Below is the table of contents for the Book (frozen in stone) and
the CD-ROM (still room for some changes here...)

Hope you like what you see.  Sorry for the wait.  But maybe there is time
for you to get your composition/tutorial finished and included on the
CD-ROM.  I'd love to hear from you.  Thanks for your patience and support.

I know Csound pretty well, but I can't tell you how much I have learned.
The contributing authors are the world's experts.  They are the greatest
teachers and have focused their work on their favourite subjects.  I can't
wait for it to be out. Every chapter is dripping with working instruments.
For the first time, I think, you can explore and learn computer music
synthesis, signal processing and sound design with your mind, your eyes,
your hands and your EARS.  It all runs!  And all the code is right there
for you to run on your own pc!  You're not just reading about it... Ever.
It is a perfect complement to the Road's Computer Music Tutorial. All the
theory is there and all of it runs here. Soon it will be all yours.

My thanks to the brilliant and dedicated contributions of all the members
of the Csound community.

The function that you use to generate a wave form for
an oscillator has very little to do with its sounding
like a particular real instrument.  It is the time
varying aspects of the sound that make it recognizable
as one instrument or another.  

By far the most important of these characteristics is that 
of the attack envelope, and of the timbre changes of the
sound during this period.  Try this: sit at a keyboard that
is capable of imitating other instruments.  Play one or
more notes with the volume control turned off, and then 
immediately raise the volume after about .5 seconds have
gone by.  The sound's identity will be largely missing.

		(sorry for the late post)

The rumor is true.
However, I've noticed that all instruments were picking up all
channels (running Csound 3.485 (?) on PowerMac).

Sometimes, however, events sent on chanel 10 were not picked up... 
weird.



Q:

anyone tried to run Csound/cecilia on MkLinux (PowerMacs of course). 
I'm planning to do some benchmarks comparing MacOS performance with
MkLinux.  That is onceI get Csound running fine in Linux.....

I think there is an advantage in writing the score as part of the
execution of the program (orc). 
In the score file, all parameters are static, they are hardcoded. If
they would be part of the program, then you could generate them on the
fly, dynamically. (Of course, now with CSound/SAOL you can write a
small C or Perl program that generates this kind of sco files for you.)

E.g. you could write something like this:

main ()
{
   int i;
   
   InitCSound (16000, 1000, 1);
   ftSine = gen (0, 4096, 10, 1);
   
   for (i=0, i < 9, i++) 
   {
      Toot4 (i, 1, 75, (8 + i * .01), .1, (10 - i)*.1);
   }
}

Hi,
    It is said that the sliderX opcode is much more usefull,
    when using a bunh of MIDI controllers, than using seperate
midictrlX's or midicX's.
    Can anyone share his experience with this ?

I think, depending on your system, and your needs, there are advantages in both.
For example, in Extended Csound running on the ADI card, it is possible to send
a score line to a running orchestra in real-time, for immediate or deferred
performance ( I gather this is also possible in some of the public versions
too). This can also be done programmatically, as the ADI libraries include
functions to send score lines, for algorithmic composition and performance. And,
logically, the ~orchestra~ is mostly fixed, whereas a variety of scores may use
it. The reverse is less usually true. 

The main thing I think is to be clear about what programming level you are
working at. At the lowest level, the orchestra and score are distinct, separate
entities. At a higher level, they have a clearly defined communication protocol
(In Csound, it is one-way - the orchestra does not talk back to the score, as
such). 

At a higher level still, there is no reason why you should not write a wrapper
program which integrates both orchestra and score - a sort of
'composer+conductor+performer+instrument-maker' object. A bit like some modern
MIDI synths, in fact!

Though I don't use it for csound, the Peavey PC1600 is by far the best MIDI
slider box.  16 sliders, 16 buttons, and a wheel.  Any MIDI string can be sent
from any slider or button.  Also, two control voltage inputs which you can
hook pedals or home-built electronics into.

Well, I use the Peavey PC1600 and I'm happy with it.
(16 faders, 16 knobs, many setup options)

 I work it with RT Csound and
 Direct Csound. I only have a problem sometimes that one fader's movement
will sometimes
reinitialize all other faders. I am not sure if this is a hardware problem.

Could this problem be connected to my original question about using sliderX

opcodes rather than ctrlX or midicX ??

In what sense is this opcode(sliderX) more efficient ?

Tnx, Yair

Hello!

I've been trying to synthesize some drums for a while now, but they doesn't
really sound like drums at all.. :D
My problem seems to be that I don't know about any theory behind synthesizing
drums, so now i wonder if someone knows any good page for this out there?
Sample-based synthesis is out of the question, I'm afraid, as i would like to
create all my sound's from scratch!
The drums I'm interested of is the mainstream: Snare, Hihat(open/closed),
Crash etc..

hey all !

   These past months I'm using RT1.9 so all my questions regard this
version.

   I've been trying to figure out how to work with the different
'slider' opcodes,
   mainly slider8 & islider8.
   I've been laying some of my questions on you all lately and I would
like to try and
   summerize my questions about this subject :

   1. In what extent are these opcodes more efficient than using
seperate midicX or ctrlX
       opcodes ? (maybe even an example ?)

   2. When using these opcodes is it obligatory,  for instance,
        to use all 8 controllers with 'slider8' ?
        It looked like it is. Must I always define the entire array ?
        That's not  that of a problem, but is it a MUST ?

    3. When I use 'slider8' I have to put an initial value, but then
each
        instrument activation "springs" the fader's value to that value
and that of course
       is not waht I want when controlling ,let's say, a synth's
parameters in real-time
       via my MIDI controller. (The amp keeps dropping to zero).

      Csound gave an error message (something like ' illegal init
value') when I put zero as init value,
      trying to maybe skipp initialization.But it worked when I put the
minimum value as init value -
      which I understand should be done when using a function-table.In
my case the ifn is 0.

      Is there a way that the initializing could be skipped ?
     Am I making any sense  :-}

 I'm not asking this for my intelectual pass-time, I'm trying to convert
a big chunck of code
 to use these opcodes so I'm really looking forward for reply.

 Happy Csounding (must have heard that before somewhere)

        Yair

Subject: Some Stupid Questions
Sender: owner-csound-outgoing@maths.ex.ac.uk
Precedence: bulk
Status:   

While I'll diligently look through the tutorials to figure out .orc and .sco
synax....

A few stupid questions:

First of all, I'm looking into getting a new computer and upgrading another.
The new computer is going to be a mobile PII 300 notebook and I'm upgrading my
old one to a dual 450 Xeon system (if I ever get paid). What kind of realtime
performance can I expect from these two systems? I was told that there's a
benchmark page somewhere, but I've never been able to find it.

Also, what quad soundcards will actually work in quad under Csound? I found
out recently that the SB PCI128 isn't really quad, and the SB Live isn't
supported under Linux yet. Opensound is working on drivers for the RME and
Sonorus 8 in/out professional sound cards. Would those work? With 8 outputs, I
guess I could have dual quad :-)

BTW, someone mentioned (I believe it was Philip) that there's a free soundcard
driver project. What's the URL again?

Ok, now for the two most stupid questions of all.
In all of the .orc files I've seen so far, each different sound is it's own
instrument. That being the case, is there anyway to create an entire drumset as
one instrument or would it require a different instrument for each sound? If
you do have to set each one up as its own instrument, can you set up your .sco
file so that all of the drum instruments can be controlled via midi over just
channel 10 and the .sco file will convert each instrument on/off request to the
proper .orc instrument?

Finally, if I'm using a midi controller (like a keyboard) to controll Csound,
is there anyway I can change sounds in the middle of a performance without
having to change channels? In other words, can I set up Csound so that when I
send a patch change from my keyboard, it'll change sounds?

I know I'm getting ahead of myself here, but I'm just curious what all Csound
can do. I've been very impressed with it so far.
Thanks,
Jason

I think the most elegant way to do this should be with a trigger opcode, similar to
one already implemented by G. Maldonado. Thus a single instrument could trigger any
drum sound you wanted, each one stored in a separate instrument but not called
directly in the score, but specified as a parameter filed or even as a MIDI note as
you suggest.
The trigger opcode should work for any instrument, of course, so it should allow
any number of "p-fields" to be sent to the triggered instr., apart from the
duration.
Any volunteer? ;-)

Is there a function that converts beats in the score ( say the duration in
p3) to seconds in the orchestra file (say the duration of linen)?

This is one of the Big Interesting Questions at the moment. Certainly, at the
lower end of the market, I don't know of any soundcards with a true 4-ch WAVE
driver - they all offer strictly multiple-stereo devices. According to the
Sonorus Website, their STUDI/O card already includes 8-ch and 16-ch WAVE
drivers. If this is the case, it should be able to play a quad Csound file. The
Creamware TDAT-16 is based on the same card, so presumbly that also could do it.
I am concerned about your comment, however, as it implies that multi-channel
drivers are NOT available yet - which is very disappointing. Creamware have also
indicated that the almost-released PULSAR and SCOPE cards will have
multi-channel drivers; the only snag here (apart from the cost!) is that they
rely on ADAT light-pipes for the multi-channel outputs.

I am myself curious to know if any of the middle-to-upper range cards (such as
the Yamaha DSP Factory) offer multi-channel drivers.

I should add that many software packages will use multiple stereo devices to
play multiple channels (though only Cool Edit Pro seems to be able to open a
4-ch WAVE file - though it cannot save into that format) - the real problem is
finding a card which will play it through the standard Windows MMedia services.
This is why the driver is so important. In the longer term, the new
multi-channel format proposed by Microsoft should encourage manufacturers to
develop drivers, where thay have been oblivious hitherto. 

For the moment, the only reasonable assumption is that all so-called
'multi-channel' cards must be multiple-stereo, until they are directly proven to
be otherwise - guilty until proven innocent!

Oops, small misunderstanding. Drivers for Windows are available. I was
referring to the Linux drivers which are still in beta stage. Sorry for
non specifying OS. I don't have Win95 or either card, so I can't really
verify if it'd work.

Well, by test version on PC has a slider system independent of MIDI.
Still not sure this is cotrrect though.  It adds 2 opcodes to read
slider values and to set values, and ranges.  I suspect I need
encouragement!  Amazing how bored one can get on a trans-Atlabtic flight!

HI,

It's not a dedicated MIDI controller box but the Roland JP8000 has

30 sliders and nobs (assignable to MIDI controllers)
10 or so switches (they send out sys ex data though)

ribbon controller
pitch bend/mod lever
49 key keyboard
Digital Analog synth
Arpeggiator

and lots of other bells and whistles
They run around $1300.00.  

I bought mine to kill two birds with one keyboard,
lots of assignable controlers and a fat analog synth.  

Also there is the JP-8080 rack module.  It still has all the nobs,
sliders and buttons but no keyboard or ribbon controller.  However it
has something called a voice modulator that uses voice or other input
to shape modulate sound and two external audio inputs that you can
filter through it that the JP-8000 doesn't have.  Price is about the
same.  Both these units have been reviewed in Keyboard magazine.

Another idea if you are a programmer is to buy an old Roland PG-1000. 
I got mine for $100.00 It has 56 sliders and a few buttons that send
out sysex data.

Chris

I don't have any solid answers for you, but hopefully I can help you to
make an educated guess about what to expect.

I have a non-realtime benchmark page at:
http://members.tripod.com/~slinkP/pw_linux/csbench.html
...but that doesn't really answer your questions. There are no
dual-processor systems tested, no Pentiums above 233 MHz, and no one has
proposed a meaningful platform-independent way to benchmark realtime
performance. 

For realtime testing, I do have some really simple and not very good
code that I used a while ago to compare two different versions of csound
on my linux system: it pipes a steadily increasing number of score
events to csound in realtime, so you can see how many simple oscillators
you can pile on before the output glitches. I could dig up my old
messages about that if you're interested. I got the idea from the
benchmarks posted on the (RT)cmix page at:
http://www.panix.com/~topper/Cmix/benchmarks.html

As for quad cards ... I have no idea, sorry.

> BTW, someone mentioned (I believe it was Philip) that there's a free soundcard
> driver project. What's the URL again?

There are a couple of alternative free drivers for Linux in progress.
One is ALSA, which has a website at:
http://alsa.jcu.cz/
This is of interest to Csounders because, to quote from Dave Phillips'
indispensible Linux Midi & Sound Applications page at
http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/linux_soundapps.html :
 "The latest version of Linux Csound now contains all of Gabriel
Maldonado's wonderful MIDI and other realtime opcodes. Even better, it
now includes direct support for the ALSA API, which should
enhance many aspects of realtime multiplexed I/O."

I can't actually say whether this gives practical results *right now*.
ALSA is in heavy development and I haven't paid attention to their
multichannel support plans. Stereo sound does work nicely with my Turtle
Beach Malibu. One thing to note is that ALSA currently has only very
basic raw MIDI support; sequencing is not implemented. So I believe that
the cool Maldonado stuff and the cool ALSA stuff will not work at the
same time.

The other linux driver project is Guenter Geiger's "High End Sound
Driver" at http://iem.mhsg.ac.at/~geiger/high.html
but I really don't know much about it.

There's information on a number of specific soundcards at Dave's site
mentioned above, but at a glance I didn't notice anything about quad
cards.

As for your other questions... I only just got a keyboard and haven't
had time to try the csound midi support yet!

Good luck,

Strictly speaking, phase shift is a shift in time. You are really asking
about a reversal of polarity. It's helpful to keep the distinction
clear.

I believe the short answer to your question is No, but when I went to
look it up, I just got confused.

I'm looking at "The Science of Musical Sound", a GREAT book by John R.
Pierce, ISBN 0-7167-1508-2, appendix E, "Reflection of Waves", and I
can't figure it out. There's a diagram which seems to suggest that no,
the polarity does not reverse. This makes intuitive sense: the peak of a
wave (i.e. maximum air pressure) hits the wall and bounces off. When it
starts moving away from the wall, it is still a peak of increased
pressure. How could it instanly become a decrease in pressure?

But then, on the next page (p. 210), there's a note that reads:
"We see that, in reflection from a solid obstacle, the pressure of a
sound wave is reversed." This seems to have something to do with the
relationship between the signs of pressure and velocity. Quite frankly I
don't understand what this means, and it seems to contradict the
diagram. Sorry!

Hi,
   I would like to run one of my codes, written for RTCsound,
   on DirectCsound, and it seems like everything works
   except that some MIDI controllers (Peavey PC1600), work
   and others don't.(e.g. controller no. 1 is suddenly inactivated).  It
was bug free on RT.

   Does DirectCsound have problems with certain controller .numbers ?
   Did I miss anything basic regarding MIDI and the move to DirectCS ?

   It was hard to tell at the state I was, but that apeared to be my
only problem.

   Any advise ?

   Yair.

Hi Anders
I  remember reading that the vertical placement of sound is recognised by the
effect that the ears shape has on it .Sound reaching us from variuos heights is
filtered by the ear to a different degree depending on its height.

	I've read, and have had demonstrated to me, that sounds along the vertical
plane are distinguished by clues other than sound. In other words, when
sound is the only clue, you can only tell left and right, not up, down,
front or back.
	A friend with a little beeper won $5 proving this to me. One test, when he
convinced me that the beeper was in front of me, I clearly 'heard' that it
was in front of me, when in fact it was above me.

The skin of the ear acts as a bandpass filter. Since it is asymmetrical
about each axis, clues are gained about where the sound is coming from,
(up, down, in front, behind). I have heard this demonstrated by
synthesising a shallow bandpass filter, (about 3dB I think) and sweeping
it up and down over a noise source. The reason the bleeper idea wouldn't
work I suspect is that there was an insufficient number of frequencies
in the source. Incidentally you must close off one ear, (stick your
finger in it) to hear the effect. No, it's not a joke- you really hear
the sound seem to go up and down. It also works on headphones.

This is more of a UNIX question then a Csound
question, but I am interested in furthering
the discussion about handling floating point
wave files.

Now that .wav floats are supported, I am trying
to put together a couple of shell wrappers that
will make manipulating and playing them a bit
easier to handle.

I came up with this script as a cheap floating
point sound player:

        SCALE_AMOUNT=`scale $1 | grep 'Max scale factor' | cut -d'='
-f2`
        scale -W -s -o/dsp -F$SCALE_AMOUNT $1 &
        vplay /dsp

where '/dsp' is a fifo which is world r/w-able.
When I attempt this, scale dies with 'error writing Wave header'.

I don't understand why, because I can do this:

        cp sound.wav /dsp &
        vplay /dsp

This plays the sound.  I don't like the idea of temp files as much,
because of the disk space requirements, and the lack of a
synchronization
between the processes such as the fifo provides.  

What might be nice would be the filename trick that csound uses to 
pipe to a process (-o '|vplay').  Any other suggestions?

Thanks

Toby

Hi Joe,

By programmer I meant computer programmer.  The PG-1000 sends out
short system exclusive messages. You would have to write a program in
C, C++, or BASIC to read the PG-1000 sysex messages translate them to
what you want and then re-transmit them thru something like Hubees
loopback to your sequencer, Csound or keyboard.

Hmm... this might be something..
The problem is to find the right parameters for the BP-Filter.

My first experiment was to simulate the first ground-reflection,
but it didn't work. (That's why the question about how the sound
reflects)

Does anyone have any data's regarding on how the head act as a filter?
(rolloff etc)

Hola Josep,
lately I have been using a FM3, a 200$ small box with 16 sliders, that
transmit volume messages.
It is from JL Cooper. However the sliders are very short. Maybe the Peavey
1600 is a better option, but of course much more expensive.

P.S. Josep, puedes encontrar el FM3 en Ventamatic por unas 30.000 ptas.

Probably no reason at all, other than for portability between machines. On
non-Intel unix systems, aiff would probably be a better bet, as no byte-swapping
is needed. They may be more likely to parse and play it correctly, too! Until
Microsoft defined Type-3, all floating-point formats have been more-or-less
unofficial, with therefore little scope for portability. It will of course be a
while before ~any~ machines can play them directly.

Subject: A wave-packet synthesizer
Sender: owner-csound-outgoing@maths.ex.ac.uk
Precedence: bulk
Status:   


Hey :)
I've changed the previous 'wavelet packet instrument' I sent last week to a 
more generic and versatile 'wave-packet synth'. Now you can change the 
filter, and the filter sequence (which determines the particular 
wave-packet) at any time during the running of the instrument. The current 
score shows some of the possibilities.
In any case, a function table is generated with the particular anticonvolved 
wave-packet, and then a simple instrument drives it. The difference is now 
you can change the signal table anytime during the performance.

Instrument 1 selects the filter:
;   str  dur  filter (1-5)
i1   0    0     1

Use it when you want to switch filter from the 5 available; its duration can 
be 0, and the filter number you pass it, becomes active till a new instance 
of the instrument overrides it

Instrument 2 selects the filter sequence, by specifying a string of 0's 
(LPF) and 1's (HPF):
;filter sequence table
;        4096 2048 1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2
i2 0 2    0    1    0    0   0   0  0  0  0  0 0 0

The actual sequence of zeros and ones determines the particular wavepacket 
that will be active form that instant on.
Again, invoke it any time you wish the particular wavepacket to change; its 
duration can also be 0

Instrument 3 keeps the toneburst generator running: must be active during 
the whole performance
;  str dur  vectab vecsz wavsz 1pos
i3  0   8     10    8192   4     0

Finally instrument 4 sounds the current signal table. Activate it any number 
of times, with different durations and frequencies, to generate the sounding 
'notes'.
;  str  dur vectab dynrng frq0 frq1
i5  0   1.8  10     30000  44   22

As you can see, there is a wide palete of timbres that can be made; trouble 
is finding them... Also I think there's a bug in filter 4 (the damn things 
are everywhere), so give it some slack (nothing prevents you from changing 
its coeficients to other wavelet filter you happen to know, and updating its 
size in the size table).
The resulting sound is sometimes too bright, so the last instrument (the one 
that sounds) could use some nice low pass filtering (just use one of the 
great filters that have been proposed here by Hans Mikelson, Josep 
Comajuncosas and others)
Dont forget to see the resulting soundwaves at close range, since the result 
is usually nicely shaped
Btw, this score takes a few minutes to run
Hope you have fun, and please send me your comments

Hello,

I am trying to relink CSound with a new opcode.

I have tryed the example in the CSound help file but I cannot make it working.
It says there is an error in "cs.h".
1. What am I doing wrong?
2. Are there other examples somewhere?
3. Why are you not programming in C++?
4. What kind of compiler do you advice me? I am currently using:
miracle.............. It does not miracles at all.

Yours,

Csounders,
  I have monitored this mailing list for long time, and I have realy
learnt a lot (many thanks to all of you). Now it's time to be more
present and to participate first by making public
a tool I have developped for Csound. It certainly can't be equivalent to
Cecilia
or Silence, but brings new exploration capabilities in the domain of
VRML generation, and in
usability level. HPKComposer (its name) is a graphical composition tool
written in Java
that is combining the Cmask score events approach, a high level software
synthetizer that hides
the Csound opcodes complexity, a dynamic definition of Instrument
parameters and their use in
the Score, the mapping of score events to VRML evolution, the background
compilation of the
Csound file and the capability to listen to the resulting sound file
from the application. In
fact Csound is totally hidden behind the user interface, but it is there
:)
  The sound generation is not limited to what is included in
HPKComposer, as you can extend it
by developping new Java classes. The different sound generators that are
included come from
this mailing list. I have slightly redesign them and put it in Java
code. This is not an OO
Csound: you continue to use the standard opcodes.
  You can find more information and download it to this site
http://hplank.inetpc.com/ . It has
been developped and tested on w95, w98 and NT. It should work in another
systems, but you have
to configure it by yourself. If you try it on Linux, and write how to do
that, I will be more
than happy to include this information (same for Mac and others).
  This tool is part of an ongoing project for building a software that
is able to combine 3D
worls and sound, and to allow outside interaction. The first steps are
this exploratory program
HPKComposer, and another program that let me control VRML animations
using a MIDI keyboard. The
next steps are to try to link everything and to use Csound in real-time,
another long story....

It's been talked about, but I don't know of any specific proposals. However, it
could easily be done as a proprietary extension to the new multi-channel WAVE
format recently proposed by Microsoft. Martin Puryear recently posted the whole
spec on the music-dsp site:

http://shoko.calarts.edu/~glmrboy/musicdsp/sourcecode/mulchaud.rtf


Much will depend on how 'public-domain' the B-format is - I am still not clear
about this!

There will probably also be plenty of discussion about this on the
surround-sound list. Whatever people think about Microsoft (and I think a lot of
very different things, at different times..), I think this is an interesting
initiative, which should ultimately result in more hardware being able to play
Csound quad files!

I'm interested in using Silence but it requires java and Swing and
symetec.itools??
I think that's what the web site said.
does anyone know where I can download all of this stuff and some less
vauge information about running silence would help as well.
thanks.

Hi everyone,

I notice that the Csound FAQ has not been updated since 1995 and could
really be a lot more useful than it is. There's a few things I was
thinking of writing up to add to it (mostly a lot of links to more
information, of which there are many, but newbies won't necessarily know
where to look...)

I've written to Martin Dupras and not heard back. Is Martin out there
anywhere? Does he still maintain the FAQ? If I don't hear anything, I
may eventually just take matters into my own hands :)

I've seen occasional proposals on this list for other things to add to
the FAQ. If/when I get the time, I wouldn't mind adding some of those as
well.

Regards,

Hi folks,

Well, the old mailing list archive on the web
(at http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~james/csound_list/ )
is still not happening. 

I would like to propose adding an archive of this list to
http://www.egroups.com/ 

This seems to be easy to do, it would update itself automatically, and
egroups seems to have pretty good searching & browsing capabilities.

If anyone has any objections, or thinks they have a better idea, please
say so. I think this would be a valuable resource (I for one used to use
James' old archive all the time). Unless the group decides otherwise, I
volunteer to make this happen.

Regards,

well hes definitely not around here, although his picture is on the wall
of ex-grad students and i see his thesis sitting on the shelf in my office..

on top of the FAQ - the "Front Page" seems pretty out of date as well.
who is supporting that presently?

im surprised MIT or Berklee dont have a Csound "official" page
with textbook coming and all...

The basic idea is that this table lists for the first five formants of
the singing voice the freq., bandwith and amplitude values - you have to
use five calls to the FOF function with the listed values and add the
outputs. The best example is the POF.orc&sco by Paris Smaragdis. It is
somewhere on the WWW, but I forgot the URL.
Probably one of these, or not very far from it

Good luck,

It's an audio signal that is used to start the "string" vibrating.
Usually some kind of short noise, but you can use what type of signal you
want.
If you play some continious audio through repluck you can get some metalic
sounds as
the "string" get triggered by frequencies in the sound.
Actually you can use repluck as a kind of springreverb by using a low
frequency for icps.
Or you can feed a delayed outsignal back into repluck to get feedback.

Never heard of it!  Apart from using my compiler (on Acorn and SGI), I
have used SGI, gcc, Lattice, Zortech, Symantecs, Micro$oft,
CodeWarrior, and probably others I forget.  It does rather depend on
your processor though!

You can excite with any audio signal.  I have used speech for example,

sorry -- i meant "apple" when i said "mac"
in other words, i want nothing to do with digidesign
and want header info in resource ---
(ive never heard about DSP Designer or MacMix except in
SH saveAs .. are these commercial apps?)

SND resources contain the actual sound data in resource as
well, am i right?

try again: anybody know if there is a standardized header (AIFF-C
 format chunk?) for B-format (ambisonics) sound files?

Digidesign, DSP Designer and MacMix (all pretty much the same format).
And, of course, SND resource files.

Hi,

	Anyone else have problems using sndwarp on a mac with virtual memory on?
I'm finding that the time point arg works intermittently; it's more likely
to work when I ask for a comparison signal in the output, but this doesn't
ALWAYS work.  I am using it correctly, as I tried the same code on an
SGI/UNIX with great results. 
	Other useful details: I have a ppc with 24m RAM, and add an additional 24m
with virt memory.  Also, the sound is a bit big, but not too big: my table
size is 262145.  Help?

	There are a few resourses not updated on the web: the latest manual I can
find is 3.47, though I know a 3.48 exists online at Univ of Wash.  Also,
the "official" csound front page at leeds says 3.46 is the most recent..
etc etc.
	To whom do we address a request that the available information be updated?
 The mac ppc port isn't linked on this page, btw.  It seems like getting
started with the most recent version of csound would be a bit confusing;
everything is a bit decentralized.

I have missed having an archives too.  It seems that James' interests have
taken a different direction.  It would be nice to have a stable archive

The sursound list:

send email msg to:
	majordomo@lists.uoregon.edu

with the following text in the body of your message:

subscribe sursound yourname <youremail@host.domain>

You do need to include the <> signs around your email address.


This info by the way is from Richard Elen's new ambisonics web page:

	http://www.ambisonic.net

He says that David Malham is providing a mirror of this site for European
surfers.

I'm having trouble downloading the package.. are there any mirror sites?

There seem to be so many variations of csound cropping up lately,
especially for windows, it makes me think theres a lot of wasted
(duplicate) effort going on..

Is there a site that reviews all of csound variations. and visual
interfaces, tools etc?

done as I can't check my mail during the day (France zone). But you you are
right  I have developped using swing version 1.01 and then 1.02. In these
versions the FileChooser is a preview and is working but not perfectly. I
think you are using 1.03. I am going to upgrade my environment and the to
upload it on the server. After that, I think that you may encounter problems
with file management. This is in this area that you can help me, as I am not
sure my code about path and extension separator.
I will post a message as soon as the new version is ready.

This is just to say I've used Bill Schottstaedt's excellent sndlib
routines to give another life to
some grand old cmd line tools of software synthesis..'sndin', 'sndout' &
'sndnorm' (More to follow).These are built around the c i/o stdin stdout
stderr model. the original versions of this software come from the CARL
project at UCSD and IRCAM of about 12 or so (!) years ago. They have
been completely re-written to now open many styles of sound files. I
imagine they will port fairly easily, but as I did this quickly over the
weekend, all I have is the linux version (glibc..RH5.1 binary). I
include source, so go to proting  it, if I don't beat ya to it....
To get them:  utils.tar.gz
look at
http://www.charlieb.com/
(my insanely out-of-date home page)

Hey,

Please forgive the stupidity of a complete newbie. I've been trying to
compile the wave-packet synth orc and sco files to get sort of an idea
of what Csound can do. Using the lastest (as far as I know) Linux
version of Csound, this is what I got:

What am I doing wrong here? Is there something I'm missing from my
version of Csound or what? Thank in advance.

The latest HTML version of the manual is at
	ftp://ftp.musique.umontreal.ca/pub/CsoundManual/
it's on v3.48b1. This is the least unofficial manual.
There is also a (my) windows hlp file at
	http://hem.passagen.se/rasmuse/Csound.htm
which is on version 3.48.

Yes, thank goodness (and Jffitch et al).

There was a new FAQ initiative not long ago. The (well, a) FAQ team consisted 
of tolve <tlv@tuna.net>, Marc Resibois <Marc.Resibois@ping.be> and myself 
with help and suggestions from Richard Boulanger <rcb@media.mit.edu>
(although I didn't do anything at all after initial encouragement).
It seems to have gotten stuck at half ready. The faq was loosely connected to 
the Csound book CD-rom release, and seems to have dropped into the same 
time-warp (what do you say friends?) There'll probably be another round soon 
enough. If I may speak for the team in this matter, I presume that suggestions 
and contributions are welcome.

The answer is very easy: the ftgen statements are followed by a long
list of numbers which are wrapped by the e-mail client on sending.
So simply put all these numbers on one line and it works.
Succes,

That's great! BUT... it would really be useful if we could see the
current status of your FAQ-in-progress. Otherwise, how will we know what
still needs work?

Could you or Richard or Tolve or Marc put it on a web page or ftp site
somewhere so we can take a peek?

Welcome to the world of free software. This is always a tough problem to
solve.

As long as we're discussing updating the FAQ, one thing it really ought
to have is a current list of all the versions of csound and all the
known available interfaces and tools. I don't think software reviews per
se would really belong in the FAQ, but I agree that this would be a
useful thing to have somewhere.

John,

I have tried several times to post this to the list
(csound@maths.ex.ac.uk) but, for some reason, my message has yet to
"appear". Hence, I thought I might send this along to you as I know you
would be interested in this posting and, if you desire, might pass it
along to the group. Here is what I have been trying to send:

The following simple orc and sco files produce a 24-second soundfile
(4 seconds of sound followed by 20 seconds of silence) using the latest
version of Csound, (ver. 3.485). However, all previous versions of Csound
caused the following orc and sco files to produce only a 4-second
soundfile. Here is the orc and sco:

;ORC
sr = 44100  ; sample rate
kr = 882    ; control rate
ksmps = 50  ; number of samples in control period (sr/kr)
nchnls = 2  ; number of channels (mono)
           

instr 1
a1     soundin "left.wav" ; (wave file 2 seconds in duration)
       outs    a1 * 1, a1 * 0
endin

instr 2
a2     soundin "right.wav" (wave file 2 seconds in duration)
       outs    a2 * 0, a2 * 1
endin

;SCO
i1  0  2
i2  2  2
e

Why does Csound 3.485 now add 20 seconds of silence at the end for the
above orc and sco files whereas all previous versions did not?

Message written at 06 Oct 1998 08:18:47 -0400

At ICMC (International Compouter Music Conference, Ann Arbor, 1 Oct-6
Oct) we managed to catch up with Ng from Leeds Computer Music Group;
we asked if they could remove this page as it was a problem, and as I
have previously said, I have received complaints direct to me about
this, but I never got any response from them.

Anyway, Dr Ng seemed genuinely upset, and clearly did not know about
it.  I have forwarded him some of the more recent complaints, and I
think we will see action when he gets back to UK and recovers from
jetlag.  I should note that as well as myself, Richard Boulanger, Alan
Schindler (Director of the Studios at The Eastman School), and Doug
Sery from MIT Press, all asked for some action from the poor guy.  He
got the message!

MIT Press have offered to help maintain a Csound page, and this seems
like a symbiotic process.  Clearly we, the community, will have to
monitor and assist, but it seems a good way forward.

Until we get the details with the Press sorted out I will construct a
'temporary' front page, which I could host on a variety of machines,
either in the UK or USA.  

The other related issue is FAQ.  It appears that a new FAQ has ben
written and is being checked,  It should go on the new main page but
as soon as I get back to England on Thursday I will arrange that it is
on teh Bath and UMontrreal ftp servers, and there is a version on the
web somewhere.  OK, not immediately as I have to give a lecture as
soon as I get back, so after that.

As you all may appreciate the Book has been taking a lot of time and
energy, and it is not yet totally out of the way; our first priority
for some months has been to nail this.  The MIT Press stand at the
ICMC meeting was showing the draft, and it is being fast-tracked for
production.  I could not get a strong date from them, but certainly by
1-June-1999.  There was also a draft of the CD-ROM which goes with it,
with sound examples etc.

So guys things are going well.  If the Leeds page is not taken down I
will post an address for you all to complain(!).

Hi Jason
When people post up code with a "/" at the end of a line it means that
the line is so long that they have to word wrap. Take out the "/" and
continue wth the contents of the next line.
The pprogram expects a word at the beginning of each line rather than a
number. Hence the errors.

I've been checking this hlp file, and have a couple of minor questions to 
the list:

As far as I can see ther has been no improvment with spectral ugens/data 
types since v3.47 (which I'm still using), right?
I dont think the documentation available is all that clear, but I understand 
these ugens are still in construction. Nevertheless I'm curious as to 
applications, so does anyone know of orc/sco's, additional documentation or 
any extra info on the spectral ugens?

Another small question: where is that formant table on the help file, that I 
cant find it anywhere? I've seen it mentioned recently

Hi,
 
I also have a quite elaborate FOF vocal orchestra on my web site. A
mini-composition is available for download as a .aif file, and the Csound

Hello,

recently I saw some csound orchestra that use this opcode but I haven't
found any documentation on that.

Is somebody can tell me how does it work??

Hi,

I am thinking about publishing a Csound E-Zine and am looking for
contributers and suggestions.  This will be in html format with pictures as
either gif's or jpg's.  Sound samples can be included as either .au, .aiff,
.wav or mp3.  The articles should be informal although a few equations are
usually helpful in understanding things.

I think I will be able to publish 4 times each year assuming I get some
contributions and I remain enthusiastic about the project (you can help with
both).  I will try to keep back issues on the web site for reference.  I
think I have plenty of disk space on my reality.sgi.com site.  There are
currently no plans to pay the contributers or to have advertisements on the
E-Zine.

You must own the copyright for the material to be published.  You will
retain your own copyright to republish the article as you wish but you must
grant the E-Zine permission to publish it as well.

The topics I will be considering are presented below.  I am open to other
topics as well.  Let me know if you have an article prepared for the E-Zine
and I will tell you how to get it to me.  I may have to work out something
for large files (>1 megabyte).  Remember to include your name and email
address in the article.

Editorial

This section will be reserved for such heated discussion areas as converting
C to C++, creating a new language Csound++ or other topics of controversial
nature. This will be an opportunity to make your point in a well thought out
manner.

Beginners Section

This section will be targeted at the Csound novice and will provide
information on things like creating very simple orchestras and scores and
examining individual opcodes. Please include the orchestra, score and block
diagrams for contributing articles.

Synthesis

This section will present novel or conventional synthesis techniques.
Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra & score, a
description of the theory involved. Discussion of a single instrument is
appropriate for this type of article.

Sound Processing & Sound Effects

This section will present novel or conventional sound processing techniques.
Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra & score, a
description of the theory involved. Discussion of a single instrument or
effect is appropriate for this type of instrument.

Real-Time Csound

This section will present an example of using Csound in real time. Articles
should include block diagrams, example orchestra & score, a description of
the theory involved, any special command line options and processor or
operating system requirements.

Featured Composition

This section should provide a description of the composition. Compositions
should be around 1-5 minutes in length. They may be presented as an
orchestra and score or as an MP3 file. Csound should be used or >50% of the
composition.

Inside Csound

This section will take a detailed look at the C side of Csound. Topics might
include adding opcodes to Csound, how reinit works or explore other Csound
internals.

Announcements

This section will be for software and book announcements and updates.  Try
to describe the product and any special hardware or software requirements.

Interviews

If someone is good at writing interview questions let me know and I will try
to obtain interviews with some of the major players in the Csound community.

Resources & Links

A list of links for other Csound resources on the web.

Cover Art

Looking for audio related artwork.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Hans Mikelson

Actually I think that people did not want it removed but wanted it to be
updated and fixed if possible.  I think that this is probably not possible.
A better approach will be to create a new page with someone who is more
interested and capable of maintaining it.

I looked at the web page Dan Gutwein pointed to
(http://www.wm.edu/CAS/music/gutwein/dgcomp.htm) in a previous CSOUND
list message. On the page there was an ORC and a SCO file. When I ran
the ORC at http://www.wm.edu/CAS/music/gutwein/Csound/4FOForc.txt with
the SCO at http://www.wm.edu/CAS/music/gutwein/Csound/VcUvcSco.txt
through CSOUND, they failed to run with a message:

INIT ERROR in instr 1: invalid ftable no. 6.030000
ifmnt0h itable  0       p13     0       0       0

Is there a different SCO file for ORC? I am interested in trying to hear
the results and using the orc file as the basis for my own work.

Derek,
This error message is indicated that the classpath is not correct. For
exemple, if you have unzipped hpkc.zip under the
directory c:\hpkc, then you must put c:\hpkc\hpkc.jar in the classpath: jre
-cp c:\hpkc\hpkc.jar.......
If you have any problem send me your hpkcomposer .bat and where you have
installed the program.
The program requires Swing 1.02 or Swing 1.03. I am upgrading it to Swing
1.1 beta 3 which has the final APIs and package name. It should be done
soon.

Dave, you are pushing me to upgrade sonner than I have expected. But that's good
:). I must adapt the code to swing 1.1 beta 3 as its has the final package name.
It should be ready soon but it will work only with this version. Hope this is
working well on Linux, I have found some bugs in this version but it shouldn't be
a problem.
By the way, what a mess this Swing package versionning.

Sorry,

This score will work.
I've since removed that score from the site.  I will immediately put a
score on the site that demonstrates the orchestra and is taken from the
composition now located at the same site.

Hey All,

After getting about 20 or more messages telling me I need to take the
word wraps out of my files, I'm happy to let you know I did get it
working. Evidently it was a stupid question considering how many
responses I got :-)

Considering how many people are on this list, I can only imagine that
some of you have come up with some pretty awesome sounds and or
compositions. If you think you have something worth sharing, I'd love to
hear, so feel free to send me what you've got (to my email address and
not the list of course. We don't want a bandwidth overload). 

I'm especially interested in hearing some cutting edge lead synth sounds
that'd go well with some of the industrial syle stuph I'm working on
right now. I'm not really looking for something that's an exact copy of
an analog synth (although I'd love to hear those too), I'm more
interested in sounds that only Csound can do.

I wouldn't mind hearing some sample synthesis sounds as well, especially
guitar sounds. I'd like to take some basic guitar samples and give them
a bit of a synth edge and then trigger them from my midi guitar
controller. Oh, and some guitar effects would be nice (distortion,
flange, chorus, etc..). I've got that Eventide emulator file which is
quite impressive.

Oh, has anyone come up with a drumset that conforms to the GM drumsets?
I know they're kinda boring, but it could come in handy every once and a
while. I was planning on doing it myself, but if it's already been done,
why do double work?

Finally, if you've got an entire song you've done in Csound, I'd love to
hear it too. The more files I look through and the more I hear, the more
I learn. Hopefully pretty soon, I'll be showing off my files to you
guys. Until then, I'm gonna watch and learn.

Once again, thanks for all the help.
Jason

PS: I'm sending my ISP a message telling them to temporarily increase my
disk quota so I can hold all the files I'm gonna receive. :-)

Hi,

The orc that is currently on the site does not call for any soundfiles.
The former orchestra was part of a larger composition.  I've removed it
from the site and replaced it with only the FOF instrument mentioned in my
original email.

I've tested both orc and sco with Winsound 3.481 and they work fine (except
for a very few samples out of range that can be fixed with a few simple
edits).

The site again is:

http://www.wm.edu/CAS/music/gutwein/dgcomp.htm

Good Luck

I am happy to announce the release of my new software Pedalfects.  Pedalfects
is an easy-to-use real-time effects processor for Macintosh (a Windows version
is in the works). Pedalfects can use the audio input to your computer, an
audio CD, or a sound file as input. You can hear your effects in real-time and
also record to disk.  Pedalfects can process up to eight simultaneous effects,
including delays, filters, modulation effects, compression and gating, and distortion.

	Visit http://www.nmol.com/users/mikeb/pedal.htm for more information and to
read the online manual.

	Pedalfects is shareware.  Before registration, the recording and saving
capabilites are disabled.  The registration fee is $100 U.S.

	Please try it out and let me know what you think.

In the html set, you'll find it through the last link under Appendices on the page 
CONTENTS.html. In the win hlp file, look for "Vocal formants table" in the index. 
I'll add an index under "Formant..." something for next version.

You like starting OS wars, do you? ;-)

I presume, from the subject line, that you are specifically asking about
OS's for PC boxes. 

Fastest? I don't think it matters that much. Most of the performance in
Csound depends on pure CPU performance, whenever you're running
something complex, where number-crunching becomes the bottleneck, as
opposed to disk activity. This is independent of the operating system.

Reliable? If you mean to ask which OS is more reliable, and not whether
csound itself runs more reliably on a certain OS, than that question is
probably not specific to this list. I'll just say that most people
accept that  Linux is far more robust than any of the Windows variants.
But this may not matter much, if your Windows setup happens to be
dedicated to always running the same apps, in a combination that happens
not to crash for you.

Personally, I have switched from DOS/Windows to Linux for my
computer-music experiments. The reason for the switch was that I noticed
that the availablity of most of the research-oriented computer-music
packages was better on Linux. After all, NextStep, Sun,  etc,  are
basically Unix, and therefore the Linux ports are easy to do, and are
less foreign then dos/windows ports of these softwares, where some
freatures might be missing.

DOS and Windows 95 work great IMO.  DOS crashes less often
but there are fewer Csound-related applications for it.
Plus Windows 95 will run most (all?) DOS apps too.
Visual Orchestra (Win95) is a great learning tool for Csound.
Linux has a few apps not available in Win95 like Cecilia, but
you have to configure Linux lots to get it up and running.

However I think all of the OS's you mentioned work equally
as well with Csound.

Hey Hans :)

Count me in: I'd be delighted to offer some explained instrs's, tutorials or 
whatever material that you find interesting.
I think that is a great initiative, and am looking forward to see the 
results. Coming from you it can only be great :)

Uh-oh, flamefest warning in effect!

I have some benchmarks online at
http://members.tripod.com/~slinkP/pw_linux/csbench.html

Speed: I've run Linux and Win95 versions of csound on the same hardware
(Pentium 133/48) and found that Win95 was actually slightly faster than
Linux/X-windows. However, I'm not sure what compiler was used for the
Win95 version I had (csound95.exe, actually a dos version of csound, I
forget where I got it.) Also, that was only with one orc & sco, and the
Linux version was dynamically linked, while the Win95 was static, I
think. (I should recompile my linux version w/ same compiler for static
linking and see if that makes any difference.)

Reliability: It's probably not very controversial to say that Linux
should be more reliable than Windows 95 or DOS.

As for Macintosh, I have no experience with csound on Macs.

Bye,

Hans,

I love it! This is a brilliant idea! Count me in. I will try to
contribute things as I'm able. I'm no csound expert, but I'm learning.

Specific comments:

> If someone is good at writing interview questions let me know and I will try
> to obtain interviews with some of the major players in the Csound community.

This would be cool. Maybe we could pool questions and you could take
your favorites from the suggestions you get?

An obvious choice for interviewing: Barry Vercoe! He's not too visible
in the online world of csound, and it might be interesting to learn more
about his work and how/why he developed csound, and also what he himself
has used it for.

Hey, as long as we're talking about the father of Csound, why not the
godfather (or grandfather, or whatever)? Is Max Matthews still around?

> Resources & Links
> 
> A list of links for other Csound resources on the web.

I assume you mean that this should be one document that is gradually
updated and added to, rather than something new each issue? At least
that makes sense to me.

Here's a low-priority-but-fun idea for either a feature article or a
permanent resource: a Csound discography. A listing of recordings that
are KNOWN to feature works produced using csound.

One thing I would like to contribute: Currently I'm trying to write a
score-generating/processing language using Perl. If I get results that I
think are worthwhile (that is, if I actually find it as useful as I
hope!), I will write an article about using Perl for this purpose, with
examples from my code. Actually my code will be available, probably
under the GPL, so I'd likely include the whole source with the article.

I might ask around if anyone else would like to contribute to this
article; I know that Eric Lyon at least uses Perl with csound, since
he's the one who suggested it to me!

Do you have a target date for the first issue yet?

Regards,

PW

Hello,

good idea! I would like to provide informations about the tools I develop.
Sections for  discography, events and upcoming competitions would be great
too.

Hi people,
I ported this peaking lowpass from an article by Jon Dattori about
effect design in JAES97. The filter itself (12 dB) is not very
impressive and dont expect to get too much resonance from it. But it
works and has a nice character.It may also be something wrong because I
cannot hear any difference beetwen the 12dB and the 24dB version... ,
I must look at the spectra...
Enjoy it!

Hi
I think repluck may work as a variant of the Karplus-Strong model. Aexcite
is simply a continuous signal feed to the string model, thus the model
conferes its resonances to the incoming signal. If aexcite is a burst of
filtered noise it should not be very different from the pluck opcode...
but Ive not looked at the sources.
Ive used it to simulate coupled strings and works fine-

Hi,

I've gotten a fantastic response to this idea.  I will try to have the
deadline for the first issue December 15, 1998.  To be published at the
beginning of January 1999.  The second issue I will try to have the deadline
March 15, 1999 and publish in May 1999.

Richard Boulanger would like to include copies of the first two issues of
the magazine on the CD-ROM accompanying his upcoming Csound book so keep
that in mind if you are contributing an article.

Bye,
Hans Mikelson

Fellow Csounders-

There have been a lot of questions and discussion about an updated manual on
this list recently, so I thought I would make the following offer.

Over the last several months, I have been putting together a version of the
manual, originally for my own use, suitable for printing. I finished it (as
much as anything in Csound ever is)just recently. It is current, to the best
of my belief, through Csound version 3.485. I fully expect this to be
replaced and superceded by the Csound book/CD-ROM when they come out, but
that could be another 3 or 4 months, so in the meantime, some may find this
useful. 

It is in Adobe Acrobat format(.pdf) so it can be printed, or live on your
hard drive where it can be searched with the Acrobat Reader. Although is not
(yet) on an ftp site, I am willing send it to those who feel they need it.
Be aware these files are big. If you are interested, please read the
information below (from the read_1st.txt file), then contact me (off-list,
please) at dboothe@lyrick.com. I had originally thought to make updates
available, but, those plans are subject to review pending the release of the
book and CD-ROMS(s).

For those not interested - my apologies for the long post.

-David.

---------------------------------------
THE CSOUND MANUAL FORMATTED FOR PRINT

Purpose and Scope----------------------------------------------------

Often, it is handy to have a manual in book form. The goal of these files is
to provide such a manual for Csound, with emphasis on uniform, clear, and
easy to use layout and format. In addition, the arrangement is designed to
allow for easy updates and additions.

To this end the following features have been incorporated:
 - Hierarchical headings used for organization. 
   Allows for an extensive, logical table of contents. 
 - Page numbering in -chapter:page- format. 
   Allows updates or additions to be made on a page by page basis. 
   Eliminates the need to reprint the entire manual with every update.
 - Alphabetical "Opcode Finder" included as an "index"
 - Two volumes: Manual (for programming reference)
                Supplement (Tutorials and miscellaneous or
                            archival information)
 -Separate files for single-sided or double-sided printing,
  depending on user's preference.

File Format----------------------------------------------------------

The files are in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format. This format was chosen for its
cross-platform portability. You can download a free reader for your platform
from:

   http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html

Please register your reader with Adobe.

Printing Procedure---------------------------------------------------

The following files should be downloaded and printed if you want single
sided printing:
 - Manual.pdf   Csound reference manual, complete.
                .pdf file contains bookmarks for chapters.
 - Spplmnt.pdf  Complete supplement containing tutorials 
                and archived, outdated information.

If you prefer double-sided printing, download and print the following files:
 - Manual1.pdf  Csound reference manual, odd numbered pages.
 - Manual2.pdf  Csound reference manual, even numbered pages to be
                printed on the back side of the Manual1.pdf pages.
 - Spplmnt1.pdf Csound manual supplement, odd numbered pages.
 - Spplmnt2.pdf Csound manual supplement, even numbered pages to be
                printed on the back side of the Spplmnt1.pdf pages.

File sizes are:
 - Manual.pdf    887 kb 
 - Spplmnt.pdf   185 kb
 - Manual1.pdf   395 kb
 - Manual2.pdf   368 kb
 - Spplmnt1.pdf   81 kb
 - Spplmnt2.pdf   67 kb

Update Procedure-----------------------------------------------------

I plan to update this manual with each major update of the Csound program.
Although the documentation contained in the manual is as generic as
possible, please be aware of any platform-specific variations in the version
of Csound you are using.

Updated pages only will be made available in .pdf file(s) separate from the
complete manual. By printing the appropriate update file(s), then inserting
or replacing the individual pages into your pre-existing manual, you will
have an up-to-date manual.

Please send any corrections or omissions me at dboothe@lyrick.com.

The maximum frame size is defined as 
#define     PVFRAMSIZE	    4096		/* i.e. max FFT point size */

There is a serious problem in making this bigger as there are internal
tables which get way too big.  Actually this is an area I had been
changing as part of the incorporation of Richard Karpen's code.  It
might be replated to some 16bit pointers somewhere.  I will look
again.

..oh and 4096 = 1024 * sizeof(float) so 1024 floats is the limit

==John ffitch

PS Hum; it is defined as 8196 elsewhere!  I will adjust it, and look into freeing this.

Again reading the code there is a hard range of overlap from 2 to 16.
I await help fom those who understand these things (RichardK? Are you
there?) and add it to the list.

I have been staring at teh code and it finally dawned on me that the
problem is that the entry structure has a short (16bit) field for the
length of the control structure.  If PVFRAMSIZE is too big one of the
structures for pvadd is too large for 16bits.  I have just rebuilt
with this field as a 32bit quantity -- but that is a real hurt as the
structure gets all out of alighnment etc.  We will see about it.
Could make the structure dynamic instead.  I will contemplate this.

Hi John,

I will plan on going through all of the pvoc-related code during the next
month, to get all of them unified with regard to all of that default size
stuff, which is not only different in the various units, but also I
believe that some of the limits are now unecessary, given modern systems.

I'll try to get you a package of revised code by mid-november hopefully
along with the "one-pass" pvoc and convolve units.

Cheers,

Richard

This is an open question to everyone who has tried to MIDIfy Csound
instruments...
has anybody succeeded in implementing an instrument which is able to
respond to Pitch Wheel messages with *any* Csound version??
Till now I get an "Unrecognized message" statement, no matter what I do.
Without Pitch Wheel everything seems to run just fine.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thancks

Hi Hans,
Im very excited with your idea. Of course Ill try to help you if
possible.This should allow for a continuous update of Csound tutorials
and improvements of existing orchestras, as well as contributing to a
closer relationship with the other members of the community.Great!
Please keep me informed about that.

I was working on such a program, for Dos. Will be finished in some months.
It's damn powerful and, so, it's not for Windows95. That's because of
overhead and latency times.
The DSP routines are all in hand optimized assembly, there are 3 versions
of each routine (Pentium, PMMX, PPro/PII), while the GUI is written in C.
It's aimed mostly at electric guitar and electric bass users, with a lot
of effects in realtime, and a lot of original and cool-sounding special
distortion effects.

I have put on the server http://hplank.inetpc.com a version that is
working with Swing 1.1 beta 3. This Swing level has more bug fixes, and
is more frozen. I have reintroduced some user interface features that
were not working well with the previous Swing version, like the Color
chooser dialog. At the beginning the application is rather slow as a lot
of windows are being built, but performaces are better after. I need
more time for tuning this application, but I have also to use it and to
build some VRML stuff, so...
Dave, I am waiting your bug reports :)

Greetings:

  I am pleased to report that as of this morning I was able to get
HPKComposer running as a Java application under Linux. Here are the
requirements, should anyone else want to make the attempt:

	Linux kernel 2.0.29 or better (might work with earlier kernels)
	Java JDK 1.1.6 for Linux
	JFC Swing 1.1 beta3

You will need to rewrite the HPKComposer.bat file to run as a shell
script, and you will also need to rename the images to accomodate UNIX
naming conventions (Linux cares lower-case and upper-case).

I have not yet tested its performance. I don't have the JMF installed
and can't yet test the audio output. I will try to do so over the
weekend. However, this program looks great and I recommend it to Linux
Csounders. I hope it will inspire other similar efforts: myself, I'd
like to see Silence and jSyn running as Java applications under Linux.

Thanks to Jean-Pierre Lemoine and his crew !

Hi Mike Berry, you wrote:

I haven't implemented MIDI so far.. didn't need it. Maybe I will implement it.

About latency times, it's 8ms IIRC.


> 	Do you have to individually support each different soundcard?

Yes. So far "Windows Sound System" and all "SoundBlaster" cards. The latter
are worse, they can't do 16bit->16bit fullduplex, but only 16bit->8bit or
8bit->16bit. WSS cards instead do 16bit->16bit fullduplex with no problems.
WSS cards are cheaper than SB, but are much better (as long as ADC/DAC goes,
rather than MIDI instruments synthesis that is of no use for this anyway).

SoundBlaster cards really suck, but Windows Sound System ones (kinda
universal standard) work just well enough.


> 	I have a different company that is going to do the Windows port of

It will be a pain, believe me. It will jerk all the time, expecially when
also recording to the hard disk. The audio will pause sometimes.. when
Winshit will decide it's about time to swap its useless virtual memory
to the hard disk.. or to process its internal databases. Windows sucks
for realtime stuff.. and also for the rest if you ask me.
Moreover, Windows is a joke. If you got a SoundBlaster card then it will
make you believe that it can do 16bit->16bit fullduplex.. while in reality
it does 8bit ADC, and tryes to fool you adding a zero byte. Windows is
less than a toy for dumb sheeps that get their blood sucked by $oft. Too
bad Windows is "the market".. and thus we've to cope with it..


>  While I do Windows programming also, I specialize in Mac.

Mac is surely a much more serious computer. I have a virtual Mac perfectly
emulated by my Amiga (68060 and PowerPC). An even more serious computer. ;-)

So you are using a DSP card? I don't remember Mac hardware well enough to
know if a DSP is standard in some model..

Thanks for the feedback, I am going to update the documentation.This program
will continue to be enhanced as its is now on a stable software base. In the
near term, I am going to code more sound generators and filters. I realy hope
that the Csound community will help me in this direction, either directly or by
providing orc files that I can analyse and transform in suitable Java classes.
This is what I have done using the contributions of Hans Mikelson, Michael
Gogins and Joseph M Comajuncosas for exemple. I will also take in consideration
any ideas for enhancing the design of the synthetizer. I expect also to add new
score events generator, I have look at the Silence design and maybe I can
combine some of these ideas. The VRML generation will be enhanced as it is very
simple today in term of geometric objects, I will also incorporate some code I
have for controlling VRML objects with a MIDI keyboard. I have a lot of ideas
by the dificult part is to select the right ones as I am developping this
program on my spare time.
In the near term, provide me with interesting orc instruments and composition
algorythm (with the formula), and I will put them in my program.

A new version 1.01 is on the server http://hplank.inetpc.com. I have
added the capabilty to set the sample and control rates in the settings,
and have corrected some bugs. I hope to have fixed a bad ouptut mixing
code that gave too small sound amplitude.

Hi
I should better know how zfilter2 works... is it Michael Casey on this
list?
Id like to know how pole warping and pole shearing affect an allpass
filter... I just think... could it be possible to implement a subsampled

allpass with a variable delay time with zfilter2? Im looking for an
elegant way to implement phasers and flangers.
Thancks in advance!

ftgen is an orchestra opcode which one expects to find in instrument 0
(ie outside any instrument) and it takes the form of a f statement in
a score.  I attach some manual information

==John ff
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ftgen

iafno	ftgen	ifno, itime, isize, igen, iarga[, iargb, ...iargz]

INITlALIZATION 
iafno - ftable number, either requested or automatically assigned
(101, 102, 103 ....).  A global (giafno) can be referenced from any
instrument in the orchestra. 

ifno, itime, isize, igen, iarga, iargb , ..- input values as described
in the score f statement, except for the following differences: 
 Ifno - if zero, an ftable number is automatically assigned (101,
...) and copied into iafno.  If non-zero, the requested number is
copied into iafno. 
 Itime - ignored, effectively the action time of this instr
(e.g. time 0 for header statements). 

PERFORMANCE

ftgen - invoke any ftable generator, as described in the Gen Routines.
This unit brings ftable generation into the orchestra.  Table creation
time is either at Orchestra Init (header statements, instr 0) or at
each action time of an instrument containing one of these units.  Each
table may be automatically assigned a number number, which can be
referenced symbolically to reduce the book-keeping that attends score
definition.  However, automatic numbering means that ftable numbers
above 100 should not be explicitly used.  (A nasty bug I need to remove)

The spectral datatype opcodes have been revised; Barry Vercoe gave me
all the code and I have incorporated the stuff.  My logs read (inter
alia)
1998-08-24  John ffitch  <jpff@weir>

	* entry.c: Entry for specptrk not in agreement with manual
	specdisp shudl have last argument optional

1998-08-21  John ffitch  <jpff@weir>

	* spectra.h:
	* spectra:c Added spectrum opcode
	
	* rdorch.c: Allow w op s,.. opcodes

	* entry.c: Add spectrum opcode

1998-08-02  John ffitch  <jpff@weir>

	* RELEASE VERSION 3.484

What else do you want?  The examples in the Csound book show how to
use them for pitch tracking and harmonisatipon.

I did a Theremin sound using a pure sinewave, and another using
sinewave with 3 harmic partials to have the timbre a little more
spookier/theremin-atmosphere.....

For the pitch/amp variations I programmed Lissajous gestures
wich gave quite an interesting movement in pitch/volume....

you could use xin/yin using the mouse to do pitch/amp gestures...

I think I still miss their point, but I must confess I hardly understand the 
underlying theory behind these ugens. I was wandering whether there were any 
examples available online. But I think I'm gonna wait for the cs-book, since 
I already have too much to do right now (I'm currently working on some 
designs, and have on my to-do list to start using realtime features at 
last...)
Thanks for the clarification

There has been a bug which comes and goes in teh area of tables; I
think it was confined to Unix.  I have it fixed now, and hope to
release 3.49 very soon for Unix, PC and Matt Ingalls has it for Mac.
I need to construct some release notes and we need a final check-up

I had this trouble to start with, you need to very carefully edit your class
path.

I did one once using fof & mouse input for pitch and amplitude.  It sounded
a lot like my Etherwave.
