As an outsider, ie neither Russian nor American, I believe there is a 
great difference here. For Americans, WWII was an overseas war which 
cost the lives of thousands of America's finest and demanded a great 
national effort. For the Soviets, on the other hand, the "Great 
Patriotic War" meant, by conservative accounts, more than 20 million 
Russian, Ukranian and Byelorussian dead and an enemy that despised all 
things Slav and was ready to enslave or annihilate a whole nation.

All this being said, and from word of mouth as I have never been in 
Russia, there is a hint of nostalgia in veteran reunions, where battles 
are often recalled and old timers shake their heads at today's youth.

Regarding the movies, I agree with Vladimir and the Russian movies he 
mentions. By itself, the piano-playing scene in "Cranes Fly" is worth 
the price of admission. For a good insight of the horror that war meant 
to the Russians, I recommend "Come and See" (or Go and Look).

As  for American movies, Slaughterhouse 5 and Catch 22 are the only ones 
that come to mind that are devoid of the "simbad" syndrome. I'm sure the 
List can point out some more.

Nice to have all of you back.


Pablo

In a message dated 98-09-22 22:48:16 EDT, you write:

<<  Is there
 any movie or a tangible piece of art to help change/solidify that
 impression ('Saving private Ryan'?) and to better comprehend your
"nostalgia"? >>

I'll do some checking and get back to you with specific titles but I can
certainly support the idea of a nostalgic view of WW2 with considerable
evidence:

At a wedding in Winnemucca, Nevada, three summers ago, I listened in on an
evening's worth of conversations between gentlemen ranging in age from 40-65
(appx.).  They spoke with noticeable frequency of "the" War, when we fought
the good fight, when we were lifted out of our Great Depression, etc.  I was
able to join in a few times because what I'd learned in school (I got
excellent marks on the big tests in US History, thought I recall little) fit
in with this.  After some time and distance, wars settle down into a more-or-
less standard character, that defined by the victor.  We won, therefore we are
nostalgic for a time when we did things right.  It even makes sense, kind of,
unlike current events.

But I'll ask around, like I said, and get back to you from a cinematic
perspective.

Hello Pablo!

Why is that every man I've ever known named Pablo has been so charming?  I
can't speak for others but I for one have been silent merely because I haven't
had anything to say.  Still keeping an eye on the list, nibbling at the
Spanish posts with my first-semester textbook.  Autumn commenced in Los
Angeles tonight, Tuesday, at 10:47 pm.  It's midnight now and I just got back
from the Tori Amos concert, at the Greek Theater (which is an open-air theater
of medium size).  You know how "when the only tool you've got is a hammer,
everything starts to look like a nail?"  I found Tarkovsky alliances at the
concert.

I think I need some sleep.
Good night,
Sarvenaz

<< I have noticed that ever since some people started posting messages in 
 Spanish (and latinized Russian), most of you have stopped posting which

 Tongues, but rather that many people simply cannot write confidently - 
 or at all -  in a foreign language. >>

Yes, I suppose I was a bit intimidated. Not so much because I saw this as a
War of Tongues. I am, in the worst sense, a prisoner of English. I could not
comment upon the Spanish/Russian postings and did not want to seem to be
hostile by ignoring them and writing in English. Not that silence has been
much of a solution, either. Quite right.

I have read through most of the Turovskaya book--it seemed to be a bit heavy
on the worshipping at times, but still well worth the read. I would strongly
recommend the Petrie book (The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual
Fugue--something like that). Still, any book on Tarkovsky is of some value,
there are still so few.

As to Thomas' idea that MIrror and Ivan could be seen as linked . . . I don't
know. There are some possible links thematically speaking (war and innocence,
youth, etc.). Both films have extensive treatment of mothers--idealized dream
sequences, etc. Beyond that I can't think of anything especially
fascinating--anyone else want to take a crack at it?

A silly question. We have lost and gained everything in this war. A second
part of the question is a real surprise, though. IMHO, the American view of
the WWII is a sindbad sailor-cartoon relative to the Russian view. Is there
any movie or a tangible piece of art to help change/solidify that
impression ('Saving private Ryan'?) and to better comprehend your "nostalgia"?

Something else springs into mind as having the effect on us as a whole you
are referring to. Letiat Juravli (Cranes fly), Idi i smotri (Go and look
(?)), Oni srajalis' za Rodinu (They fought for the Motherland), Sud'ba

I read recently that some critics see Mirror as a continuation of Ivan's
Childhood.  I've only seen Ivan's Childhood once and don't remember it
well, but I can see how that connection could be made.  However, this
connection has never been discussed to my knowledge on this list. Anybody
care to have a go?  I'm curious.  Are Russians just as nostalgic for WWII
as we North Americans are?  For us (esp. in cinema) WWII has come to
represent a time when the world was black and white and clear
distinctions could be made between right and wrong.  I'm wondering if
Tark's war movies (Mirror, Ivan) have any of that going on in them.

In a message dated 98-09-23 11:04:19 EDT, you write:

<< As  for American movies, Slaughterhouse 5 and Catch 22 are the only ones 
 that come to mind that are devoid of the "simbad" syndrome. I'm sure the 
 List can point out some more.
  >>

Also: "A Midnight Clear", "Mother Night" (both by the same director--the
latter, like Slaughterhouse Five, an adaptation of Vonnegut). For the most
part, I think that it was Vietnam that took the gloss off of war for
Americans--in fact, it is notable that most of these films were made during
the Vietnam Era or were based on books written in that same era--WWII became a
metaphor for the current war. M*A*S*H* did the same thing with Korea and
Breaker Morant (an Australian film) did the same with the Beor War. In as
sense, then, all of these films are arguably Vietnam war films.  

While not a war film "The Best Days of Our Lives" is an unusually frank film
about the post-war situation for soldiers returning from WWII--a situation
that, in part, lead to the so-called Beat Generation.
