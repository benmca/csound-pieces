Sender: owner-cecilia@ginette.musique.umontreal.ca
Precedence: bulk
Status:   

have misplaced query requesting workaround for cecilia's inability in mac
to use clipboard to transfer text from and to other modules or programs
(note that clipboard works fine within a module).

first off, there is actually a function to import and export score files
that appears in the File Menu when your active window is the Editor Window.
and this function can also be used as a workaround to import and export any
text.

in addition, you can open a cecilia module with a text editor such as BB
Edit Lite -freeware. should be available at www.shareware.com. then use the
clipboard as desired and save (do not perform a save as). Saving in BB Edit
will not affect the module's identity as a cecilia document. the module may
then be reopened by cecilia.

To the Cecilia mailing list&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11/9-98
<BR>&nbsp;I have have had problems using pvread. I seems to hang or crash
the computer
<BR>when lots of overlapping notes for the same instrument using pvread
is used. I have tried to compile it with Csound 3.47 and 3.485 for macintosh
( 3.47 crashed immediately, 3.485 hanged the computer ). Can somebody tell
me what I did wrong?
<BR>Is there a simple solution, or is pvread not suited to do these things
? This is an
<BR>attemt to create textures by taking the freqvensies from random bands.

hi,
apparently there is no activity in the mail-list,
so i don't have anyone to ask except you,
and i already tried for hours...
so if you'll be kind enough to help me i will appriciate it alot !

the problem is that when i launch cecilia, 
it start writing those "building window..."
and when it gets to the Help/Font it exists with the
following message:

X Error of failed request: BadAlloc (insufficient resources for
operation)
  Majot opcode of failed request: 45 (X_OpenFont)
  Serial number of failed request: 2567

now,
i use an SGI o2, 200mhz MIPS R5000 with 64Mb memory,
running IRIX 6.3
i have about 180Mb of free disk,
and i see no reason for it not to run.

this phenomena happens on all the o2's i've tried.
and it happens also on Indy running 6.2

what to do ???

10x.

I'm using a UMAX S900 (w/ some funkier features that keep me from running 
OS8) - Cecilia works just fine under MacOS 7.5.3 on my box.
May I suggest that the problems stem from an extension conflicting with 
the Tk/Tcl extension or that a required library isn't present?

OK, weird science time - I'm using Python for other things (web site page 
layout scripting, interface w/ MacOS for -cron type functions, etc.) Can I 
write a script which creates an "overshell" for certain Tk functions, 
which can then transmit variables through Cecilia into csound (and thus 
extending function in csound via external libraries in this way)?

As a newcomer to csound and cecilia 2.02 i'd like to know if there are cybil-scores and modules downloadable anywhere? Is there any advanced discussion or documentation available?
Cecilia  really is a great environment and i hope it can be further developped.
On my machine (power mac, system 8.0) exists a little inconvenience: it is impossible to copy and paste anything into or out of cecilia. Is there a way-around?

Dear friends,

Dennis Miller, editor of Electronic Musician, has written to me to help him
locate someone who could wrte a review of Cecilia for his magazine. I quote
Dennis' message to me:

> availability of someone you might know to write an article about Cecilia
> for Electronic Musician magazine. I am thinking that this article might
> include both Cecilia and an application on the PC called Visual
> Orchestra that also uses Csound as a shell (very different approach,
> however). The article would be partly an explanation of these
> applications and what they signify to the modern desktop composer, then
> some very specific "how to" tutorial material. I feel that your work,
> and to a lesser extent, Visual Orchestra, can really change the face of
> the computer music world, and I think the magazine, for which I am an
> editor, would be well-served by explaining and exploring this subject.
> So now I need to locate someone with the expertise to write
> intelligently to our readers - it is not CMJ remember! - and help get
> the message out. Do you have a grad student or a colleague who might be
> interested? This is a paid opportunity, of course.

If you are interested and feel you have the necessary writing skills, please
contact me directly by e-mail so I can forward a recommendation to Dennis...

Thank you!

PS. Win95 Cecilia very close now!

g'day there- ive been running cecilia  on my linux box
with great success, and now im moving towards a real time application of
cecilia (live dsp).

ive got a couple of questions relating to the Audio-in function.
I can write to the DACs no problem, but when i attempt to read audio from
the soundcard and write to the DACS, problems arise.
ie : i run this simple orc/sco (in csound alone)

/usr/Csound-3.47/ csound  -o /dev/audio1 -L stdin  -i /dev/audio0
rtinu.orc rtinu.sco 

I get a short looping buffer of ambient sound. The orc/sco compiles no
problem (and does work properlly on a mac). It may have somthing to do
with the command line. Here is the output:

Csound Version  v3.485.0b (Aug 27 1998)
orchname:  rtinu.orc
scorename: rtinu.sco
sorting score ...
        ... done
orch compiler:
26 lines read
        instr   31
MIT Csound:  v3.485.0b (Aug 27 1998)
orch now loaded
stdmode = 00000002 Linefd = 0
audio buffered in 1024 sample-frame blocks
WARNING: /dev/audio0 has no soundfile header, assuming shorts
reading 4096-byte blks of shorts from /dev/audio0 
writing 4096-byte blks of shorts to /dev/audio1 (IRCAM)
SECTION 1:
new alloc for instr 31:


The other question relates to cecilia.
When i select preview command and/or opoen cecilia window, csound does not
compile (doesnt initiate compilation) and cecilia just hangs (until i
reinit module).
This in itself isnt such a big problem, but how does one change the
command line options (ie audio devices) without this previewer- (where is
the default file kept?)

I also (on occasion) get the following error message when atempting to
preview the command....

grab failed window not viewable

Any ideas would be appreciated....

Dear M. Piche,
I am quite interested in reviewing Cecilia for E.M.... I know you
do not know my backgroud: but I a recent Ph.D. in Music Comp.
from UC Santa Barbara, currently working as Senior engineer at
"Verity, Inc." in Sunnyvale, CA... (search engine company: the
search in Netscape, Lotus Notes, and many others is ours.)
I have several pages of notes on the software already: my interest
has been specification of parameters for software synthesis for
quite a while. I am an experienced performer, as well, having
performed my way through college as orchestral trumpet player,
having studied for years with B. Goff (I.T.G.), and lessons
with Mario Guarneri (SF Sym., S.F. Conservatory), E. Tarr 
and A. Herseth (Chicago Sym.) I have been involved in 
elecro-acoustic music for many years (> 15 yrs.!), and
have used Cecilia for both commercial (local SF/SJ area)
and non-commercial (personal) music. ( the commercial work
was just a sound effect done as a favor for a local band...
I felt honored, because the band had J.O.Smith as close
friend and occasional jammer!! ;-) ). 
Speaking to my writing ability, I can only point to my
(sometime quite effusive) posts in the csound list.
Again, I have (small, but undiminished) hopes of eventually
giving up this $ and going back to my first loves of
performing and teaching music, and this review would
be invaluable in this effort. I hope that you can
see your way clear to recommending me as reviewer...
I remain,
yrs truely,
Charlie Baker

Hi,

	I'm running on a mac with 7.5.3 sys software.  I wonder if there is any
intention to have it run with the older sys, or shall I assume I must
upgrade to OS8?  I think, if upgrading is required, it would be useful to
mention this in any review.  Incidentally, the fixes mentioned in 2.02 do
not appear under 7.5.3.  I love the program, and use csound quite a bit for
my own pieces as well as work, so I'm upgrading to os8 today!  
	Is this list the appropriate place for reporting bugs in the future?  If
so, I am having trouble getting the last tutorial to function (the one with
the tk_interface material) once entered and run through csound: the
tk_interface opcodes are run directly to csound!  Thanks very much.

Ben

Yes, this is a csound problem that was solved under the 3.485 version I 
believe. I have not tried it, but you should be able to replace your old 
csound (3.47) that came with 2.0.2 with the new one.. DON not use the 
Mills front end with cecilia. You only need the Perf part.  Let me know 
if it works.. i have not tried this...

Perhaps you could detail your problem...

g'day there- ive 2 questions..

 one- is there a FAQ on linux cecilia?

two- im running cecilia on my linux redhat5.1 box, and wish to use
audio-in instead of soundin in one of the example patches that comes
default with the package... (ResonatorBank)

ie. I  replaced

a1,a2 diskin
with
a1,a2 ins

I then select the Audio-in option in csound and run the patch
 Csound returns:
        unable to open soundcard for audio output.

I am successfully running the commercial version of the oss sound drivers
with an audio pci card (which does support full duplex). Is this a
cecilia/csound problem or an oss problem (or a "me" problem)

can anyone help me here?

thanks.

hello jean,

may i infer that the following, which appears in the 3.485.1 readme (on the
server only) is already incorporated in cecilia 2.0.2?

"NOTE TO DEVELOPERS AND USERS OF
OTHER FRONT END "LAUNCHERS"
=======================================
We have completely consolidated our sources and canonical 3.485 source.
To do this, we had to change some of our Mac-Specific command
line flags.  If you are a developer of a front end "launcher"
that uses "Perf" you may have to change your application to
accommodate.  The Mac-Specific flags are now:

-X fnam         Sound File Directory
-q fnam         Sound Sample-In Directory
-Q fnam         Analysis Directory
-V N            Number of chars in screen buffer for output window
-E N            Number of tables in graphics window
-p                      Play after rendering
-e                      Rescaled floats as shorts to max amplitude
-w                      Record and Save MIDI input to a file
-y N            Enables Progress Display at rate N seconds
                                or for negative N, at -N kperiods
-Y N            Enables Profile Display at rate N in seconds
                                or for negative N, at -N kperiods
-- fnam         log output to file ("listing" file)


thanks again!

diskin loves perf 3.485.1. built-in transposer module hates it. no crashing
mind you, just returns silence or a 500 millisecond blip.

simplistic workaround: discard perf 3.485.1 so 3.47b3 kicks in, keep
original stuffed 3.485.1 at the ready to reconstitute, of course
remembering to discard 3.485.1 csound. someday maybe i'll get around to
stuffing just the perf, but no big deal.

Please help me...

I tried for several hours to install Cecilia on Linux.

I'm a Linux beginner but I tried all I could to make Cecilia run on my
system.

I've followed the readme instructions and installed the exe in
/usr/local/bin and the libraries in /usr/local/lib/cecilia.

Starting Cecilia a message appears stating that Cecilia is not able to find
the libraries.

Then I tried to declaring the CEC_LIBRARY but, this time Cecilia said that
the variable is declared but the dir is dangling...

Can you help me, please ?

I installed Linux on my PC only to try Cecilia...

Greetings, Alessandro: Stay with it, you'll get it installed. Let's see
what we can figure out...

Okay so far. Btw, what version are you installing ? Also, what Linux
kernel version are you running ? Tell us a little more about your
system...

Hmm...Assuming you're running a bash shell, did you do something like

    export CEC_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/cecilia

and place it in your .profile (or whatever it is for you) ?

If all that is set all right, then we'll have to look closer...

An excellent reason...

Okay - what you might need to do is edit your /etc/profile and add or
append:

PATH="/usr/local/bin:"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/cecilia:"
export PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH


This, of course, is assuming that you are using the bash shell - which you
probably are.

Hope this helps,
Charles

Well, the first thing to consider is a system library incompatibility.
Here's what I get when I run 'ldd /usr/local/cecilia/cecilia':

        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/elf/libX11.so.6.0
        libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1.7.14
        libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5.0.6
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.3.12

My guess is that you have a glibc-based system and that the compiled
version of Cecilia won't run under it. Run ldd on your binary and tell
me what happens.
 
I believe that S.u.S.E. distributions include both glibc and libc5
systems, though I'm not sure if they are installed by default, nor do I
know how to set up either one for compiling applications. Read the fine
manuals, I guess... ;)

Hi -

Has anybody had luck downloading the Mac Cecilia 2.02 lately? I've been
trying for about 2 weeks now, with various browsers, helper apps...

Usually I get the message "The archive Cecilia 2.0.2_mac.sit.bin has been
corrupted or may not be a valid archive. Do you wish to continue working
with it?" --- but today it did nothing at all, just called up Stuffit,
which immediately quit.

Any thoughts anyone might have would be greatly appreciated... Thanks.

Hi,
    I was curious if you could tell me if the Windoze version of  Cecilia
will allow recording of slider moves as Linux?
Thanks,
Ken
