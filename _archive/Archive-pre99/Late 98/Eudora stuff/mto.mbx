Murray,

Let me first stress that I refer here to mid-18th-century French usage in
general, not to La Porte's in particular, as I cannot check his *Traite
theorique et pratique* now. But there is no reason to doubt that his usage
matched the general one. Note also that when I wrote that "the doctrine is
in no way linked to solmization", I did not think of the doctrine of the
double system, "par bemol" and "par becarre", but of that of the double
model, aeolian and dorian, for the minor mode. This changes nothing to the
intrinsic interest of your questions.

The note names using one letter and two solmization syllables came into
usage by 1650 and have been used until the second half of the 18th century.
They have their origin in the "gamme double" which has been in usage in the
period 1650-1710. After 1710, they were no more than a mere conventional
terminology and I suspect that La Porte bestows them with no particular
signification. "Csolut", for him, must have been synonymous with "ut", so
that "le ton de Csolut" probably meant nothing more than "the key of C";
and he probably knew little if anything of the "gamme double" which by then
was obsolete.

At one time, the French terminology for the complete scale was Csolut,
Dlare, Esimi, Futfa, Gresol, Amila and Bfasi. This is based on the one hand
on a heptachordal solmization, including SI as the 7th syllable, and on the
other hand on the idea of two intertwined heptachords, "par bemol" and "par
becarre"; the order of the syllables arises from the usual presentation of
the two heptachords in two columns. The medieval terminology, similarly,
arises from the ascending presentati on of seven hexachords along the
scale. It may be noted in passing that in the second half of the 17th
century, the French also made use of a modified hexachordal terminology, so
as to always quote the syllables in the order molle-naturale-durum:
Csolutfa, Dlaresol, Emila, Futfa, Gresolut, Amilare, Bfabmi (meaning B
natural; B flat was "Bfabmi bemol"). Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his
*Dictionnaire*, quotes a "gamme italienne" with the syllables in the order
durum-naturale-molle, i.e. Cfautsol, Dsolrela, etc. These usages are
amusing, and they reveal something of a way of thinking, but I think their
signification should not be overestimated.

The matter of the "gamme double" is more important. It is, of course, the
residue of an earlier gamme that included both B and B flat and which can
be traced back to Hucbald. It is a late avatar of the cantus durus/cantus
mollis doctrine of the Renaissance and results from the fact that, since
the Carolingian era, the diatonic system was considered octotonic rather
than heptatonic (better said, it was "bi-heptatonic", consisting in two
intertwined diatonic scales). The consequences were considerable and
directly or indirectly concern Glarean's reform of the nomenclature of the
modes, the early history of pitch standards, the medieval doctrine of the
affinitas, etc., etc. I cannot develop much here; let me illustrate with
two imaginary cases:
-- suppose that, as a Renaissance composer, you want to write down a
composition in the 2d mode (D plagal). The piece is "a voce piena", with
the ambitus of each part limited to the modal octave; that is to say, the
superius covers the range a-a', the altus d-d', the tenor A-a and the bass
D-d. You want to write each part on a five-line staff, without leger lines,
and using one of the standard clef arrangements, chiavi naturali (C1, C3,
C4, F4) or chiavette (G2, C2, C3, F3). Try: it is impossible, you always
need leger lines in several parts. The solution is to transpose the whole
piece a fourth higher, in cantus mollis, i.e. in G with a flat in the
signature, and to write in chiavi naturali. This is the very simple reason
why a majority of Renaissance pieces in the second mode are notated in
cantus mollis. Similar limitations exist in other modes as well. (This also
is why I don't really believe in Powers' "tonal types", which merely
express the limitations of Renaissance notation.)
-- suppose that a Renaissance organist must accompany singers in a piece,
say, in mode 3. It is written with the final on E but, when he tries it as
written, the singers complain that he plays too low or, when playing an
octave higher, too high. The organist is not very fluent in transposition,
because of that musica ficta stuff that he never properly understood, but
he knows how to pass from cantus durus to cantus mollis (i.e., he can
transpose up a 4th or down a 5th): he therefore plays the piece in A with
one flat, and everybody is happy. With this system, you can play ANY piece,
on ANY organ, at a pitch distant, in the worst case, three semitones from
that deemed ideal for the singers; the pitch-standard at which your organ
is built therefore is of restricted importance, and this is why there were
such variations in pitch standards during the Renaissance.
It is my conviction that, in a way, Renaissance musicians made (almost) as
little difference between cantus durus and cantus mollis as we make today
between positions an octave apart. You may wonder how it can be that my
Renaissance organist can transpose up a 4th or down a 5th, and by no other
interval. This is the necessary consequence of his thinking in terms of
solmization: the transpositions that he knows are those which involve no
change of note names. Today, the only transposition without change of note
names is up or down an octave, but in the Renaissance, up a 4th and down a
5th gave the same result. (I won't consider the case of musica ficta, which
would lead us too far.)

As to your first point of worry, I am not sure I fully understand your
position. To return shortly to La Porte, keep in mind that he does not
consider the scale "par bemol", which is obsolete. What he means could be
paraphrased as follows: "There is one 'natural' collection, that which uses
the pitches C D E F G A B. If you locate the origin of the scale on C, you
get the major scale, on A, the aeolian minor scale, on D, the dorian minor
scale". Fifty years earlier, his co-citizens may have meant "There are two
'natural' collections, one formed of the pitches C D E F G A B, the other
of F G A Bb C D E. If you locate the origin of your scale on C in the
first, or on F in the second, you get the major scale; etc."
Let's agree than a discussion of the mode or a piece requires two steps:
(1) the description of a pitch collection and of its intervallic structure,
and (2) the discussion of a hierarchical organization within this pitch
collection. There is nothing anachronistic in the idea of a pitch
collection, this being but a new name for the very ancient concept of
"system" (as in the Greek "sustema teleion"). We must realize that
solmization belongs to the description of the system (step 1) and says
nothing of possible modal hierarchies (step 2). It describes the
intervallic structure of the pitch collection, much as letter names do
today (for E or B, today, like MI in the middle ages, denote a degree with
a semitone above). In order to define a mode, it is necessary to establish
hierarchies within the system by assigning specific functions to its
degrees. Usually, it is the function of final that is assigned: to say, for
instance, that degree D of the system is the final defines the protus
mode(s). If you think in terms of solmization, you may affect the function
of final to the RE's of the system, and so doing you'd define the D mode in
its two forms at once, the dorian and the aeolian forms (i.e. with B
natural or with B flat), which, before Glarean, were considered equivalent.
(The two forms of the minor mode in 18th-century France only very remotely
relate to this, I believe.)
The case is different with modern keys, because we also want to define a
pitch level, which requires a third step: (1) the background pitch
collection now is the chromatic system, in which we have to choose (2) the
position of a diatonic sub-collection and (3) a hierarchy within this
sub-system.

In all this, solmization appears as a very powerful and coherent tool. It
has important advantages (at the price of some confusion, at least from our
point of view) which the French for a while tried to retain. Needless to
say, the doctrine of the "gamme double" was intended mainly for singers,
for whom pitch did not matter in the same way as for instrumentalists, but
everybody eventually aligned on the ways of thinking of the latter.

September 18

Nicholas Meeus, in  a recent posting, rectified my usage of the 
French "ton" as English "scale," quite rightly. Whereas "scale" 
denotes merely a collection of pitches, the term "mode"--which 
Nicholas prefers--denotes (to me) as much a practice as a collection, 
and this seems more germane to the instance at hand, La Porte's 
treatise, and the question of the double system or "double gamme". 
This practice has some clarities and obscurities as yet for me, which 
I will (I hope not too obstinately) worry below (all of which takes 
us slightly further afield from Professor Lewin's discussion of the 
Bach fugue, and hexachord, which I shall return to, however):

Nicholas,

1. My principal worry is about double usage, and the nature of mode 
and scale chez La Porte.  Why, in practical terms, would La Porte 
refer to C as "Sol Ut," A as "Mi, La," and D as "La, Re" in 
distinguishing the three "natural"  pitch collections. Does this 
allow him to make a theoretical point, or was he just blithely 
adopting a convention?

Is it that La Porte's usage is a kind of short hand for: "the mode of 
C, which comprises two collections F major 'par bemol' (C=sol) and C 
major 'par nature' (C=ut), the mode of A, which likewise comprises 
two collections F major 'par bemol' (A=Mi) and C major 'par nature' 
(A=La), and the mode of D, which (yet again) comprises two scales F 
major 'par bemol' (D=La) and C major "par nature" (D=Re)?  Having 
just typed that, I can see the urge to eliminate the redundancies!  
Seriously, is there something more afoot here--something like a 
bi-"ton"-ality (which Dahlhaus worried at the beginning of his 
analysis of a Josquin motet, in his book on the Entstehung of 
tonality).
   Could La Porte have said (or better yet, why could La Porte not 
have said [if he had such anachronisms as "pitch collection"]) the 
following: "There are two collections, C (with B par nature) and F 
(with B par bemol), and they locate themselves variously as modes 
around three points of reference, C, D, and A, and which are called 
natural." This seems far too simple a formulation, and yet I wonder 
if this isn't what La Porte is trying to say with his double 
solmizations.

If this seems merely a matter of emphasis and locution, so be it; we 
have much to learn from the latter. The use of two syllables as in
C sol ut seems arcane and laboured unless by locution it indicates a 
multi-faceted system. Is La Porte (perhaps like many other French 
theorists who ascribe sol and ut to C) struggling to bring together 
two systems: 
- a system with three loci (C, A, and D), each with two pitch collections 
(nature/bemol), 
- and a tacit system of two loci (C and F), each with one pitch collection 
(C, D, E, F, G, A with either B or B-flat).

With a multi-faceted system we have something like the combination of 
gamut and hexachord (and tetra- and pentachord) that might better 
characterize music of earlier times--better at least than a more 
modern conception of one major/minor system.  Gamut gives us one mono
system of pitch names; hexachord gives us a tripartite system of 
pitch locations reckoned with regard to semitones and mapped onto the 
first system..

2. My second worry concerns provenance. Nicholas, you wrote (with 
apparent conviction!): "The doctrine [of the double system] is in no 
way linked to solmization."  In what way do you construe the verb 
"link":

--there is no contemporary linkage made between these "gamme double" 
double references (C Sol, Ut) and solmization hexachords in the 
treatises, or

--there is no historical linkage to be made between these references 
and some preceding practice of hexachordal solmization.

The former supposition seems easy to determine (since in La Porte's 
treatise, and other 18th century French treatises I've looked at, 
there are no references to hexachords).

The latter would be more difficult to determine. What is the 
provenance of the "double gamme"? I defer to my betters in this area, 
which is to me still very obscure.

   I would, of course, be tremendously excited if someone were to 
tell me that, yes in fact, the double system is a residue of a 
earlier gamme that included both B and B-flat as equal (albeit 
repellant) participants regulated by at least two hexachordal 
frames--hard and soft.  I like residues (such as Lewin's postulated 
hexachordal solmization in a Bach fugue), since the distinction 
between residual and current thought may lend insight into the 
workings of a composer's understanding.

   I won't lose extra sleep, however, if I'm told contrariwise, since 
now I have something else to worry at night--the utility of this 
French double usage, such as C sol ut.  I shall have to get out my 
Lully....

Amicably,

This is not exactly what La Porte says. When he speaks of "tons", he does
not necessarily mean "scale". What he reports is a quite common
18th-century French doctrine, namely that there are two modes, major and
minor, and that the minor knows two forms, the one corresponding to the A
scale, the other to the D scale -- let's say, an aeolian and a dorian
forms. Francois Campion calls them "mineur layen" and "mineur reyen",
refering to the scales of LA (A) and RE (D). The doctrine is in no way
linked to solmization. If these three scales are natural, it is because
they can be written without accidental (the "mineur reyen", in particular,
is the natural D scale, without B flat).
The case was slightly more complex when, in the late 17th century, the
French considered that both B and B flat were natural degrees, or, in other
terms, that a natural scale could be either "par nature" or "par bemol".
The natural scales were then C major, A minor and D minor "par nature", F
major, D minor and G minor "par bemol", with the additional complexity that
D minor was "natural" both in its dorian ("par nature") and aeolian ("par
bemol") forms. One may note in passing that the solmization names that La
Porte uses (probably without thinking of their full signification), C sol
ut, A mi la and D la re, are reminiscent of this conception of the double
system (known as the French "gamme double").  Indeed, in each term, the
first solmization syllable describes the position of the letter in a
(heptachordal) scale "par bemol", the second in a scale "par nature". C is
SOL "par bemol" and UT "par nature", etc. The usual medieval and
Renaissance names were different: C fa ut (or C sol fa ut), A la mi re, D
la sol re (or D sol re), etc.
To take the dorian scale as the model for the minor is common throughout
the first half of the 18th century. My (incomplete) references to this
usage include Werckmeister (1698), Frere (1706), Saint-Lambert (1707), 
Mattheson (1713), Campion (1716), Dandrieu (c1719), Rameau (1722), Van
Blankenburg (1739) and Soler (1762). This usage also explains why key
signatures, especially in minor, often included one flat less than today.

This said, I agree, of course, with Murray's conclusion that we must accept
the convolutions and contradictions of former times...

NM: So the quotation that I gave was from Playford (as I suspected). I had
seen no early edition of Morley. What Morley is the passage that EC quotes
is that if you solmize something that goes down and you reach RE, then it
is time to perform a mutation. Only if you are sure that no lower note will
follow can you sing UT on the lowest note. This, in practice, and provided
that there is no similar limitation when going up, reduces the number of
syllables to five. Pierre Maillard (*Les tons ou discours sur les modes de
musique ...*, 1610) says that going up you should perform the mutation
either after FA or after SOL, following these with RE. This certainly
suppresses the LA and, in a way, also the UT (which appears only as the
second function on the FA or the SOL on which the mutation is performed).
With such systems the mutation becomes more or less automatic and the
difficulties inherent in it are somewhat (?) lessened. The number of
syllables is reduced to four or five.

NM: I would indeed suppose that "Lancashire system", if it existed at all

If what you have in mind here is solmization on four syllables, and in view
of what Maillard says (I trust he is not the only one; a more systematic
research would be necessary), also considering the mentions by John Wallis
and Charles Burney that I mentioned in an earlier posting, and the one by
Playford (?) repeated above, I wonder whetehr you do not overstate both the
orality of the tradition and its isolation. I find it in general difficult
to determine to what extent national usages diverged in the period
considered.

We are far from our initial topic anyway, but isn't this discussion of

Subject: fugues and evidence
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
Status:   

More to the subject of solmization and fugue. It seemed that the 
question of evidence figured in the dialogue that followed 
Professor Lewin's paper--whether the historical record of 
Bach's time makes note of, and thus vindicates, application of 
solmization syllables to the analysis of fugue. My question would be 
just what kind of evidence is admissable in deciding the issue? (This 
is merely a part of a larger question: what evidence is admissable 
under the rubric "the history of music theory," and what is to be 
done with it.)  Joel Lester made passing reference to 
Albrechtsberger's Gruendliche Anweisung zur Composition (1790), but 
consider the following:

La Porte, Nicholas de. Traite theorique et pratique de 
l'accompagnement... Paris: n.d. [The Library of Congress catalogue 
provides no date, although 1753 is pencilled in the frontispiece; 
Fetis does not date  it either; Eitner fixes it at 1753]

The treatise is largely unexceptional, save for the following points 
of interest. 

1. On p. 5, La Porte makes reference to two scales [tons] major and 
minor.

2. On p. 9, La Porte makes reference to three "natural" scales: Ut 
majeur, La mineur, and Re mineur.

3. On p. 62, under the rubric "L'Art de Transposer Dans tous les 
Tons," :

   "Que les Tons Naturels sont au nombre de Trois (Scavoir)
Le Ton de C. Sol, Ut.  Le Ton d'A. Mi, La; et Le Ton de D. La, Re."

Later he states that all other scales are created by recourse to 
sharps or flats...so as to make them resemble these natural modes.

My interest in the treatise is that two conceptions (at least) seem 
to be at work here: a notion of two seven-note scales, to which no 
solmization syllables pertain; and a notion of three scales that 
bear striking resemblance to hexachordal theory, which are called 
"natural" for some reason.  As evidence admitted into the broader 
question of the applicability of hexachords to the analysis of 18th 
century music, La Porte's otherwise negligible treatise seems 
germane: it suggests that two conceptions might exist side by side in 
a theorist's mind, and that as we admit and bar evidence, we might 
have to take into account these manifold and sometimes contradictory 
conceptions. 
 I would suggest that such a state of affairs 
quite possibly characterizes much of the historical record of music 
theory, and in that respect may be mirrored in music--Bach fugues in 
particular--itself.  Perhaps as historians of theory it behooves us 
(I'll get off the pedestal in a minute) not to look for unitary and 
exclusive answers about matters--whether Bach did or did not, with 
certainty, conceive of his fugues in hexachordal terms--but rather 
hold that determination in abeyance, while searching out the 
convolutions and contradictions that are any composer's mind and 
music.

Subject: Re: Fugue and tonality, solmization (fwd)
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas

I would like to reply to the following question raised by Prof. Killam


>Ref Prof. Mengozzi's first segment on the meaning of "re-mi":  perhaps I'm
>not reading deeply enough into his argument, but the consistency and
>importance of "mi-fa" as a half step throughout the historical use of

Of course "mi-fa" was used to designate the half step in the practice of
solmization and in much theoretical literature (particularly in the theory
of species).  But my question is: does it follow from this that each and
every half step was also heard as the third and fourth degrees of a
hexachord? I am convinced that this was not the case. If we answer "yes,"
then we have to explain how "hexachordally-informed listeners" back then
were able to make sense of different hexachords occurring at the same time
in a polyphonic piece, with *different* pitches placed on the *same* six
scale degrees.  And we would also have to conclude that mutations were both
audible and structurally relevant, in spite of significant (though I am not
ready to say "conclusive") evidence to the contrary provided by the musical
treatises.
        There is obviously a crucial difference between the *size,* or
*species," of an interval and its *position* within the system of medieval
and Renaissance musica recta: the semitone was located between E-F, B-C,
and A-Bb, and my sense is that these intervals were considered (and
perceived) as identical in size, but not in location, quite in spite of the
fact that they could all be labeled mi-fa.  As Guido, for one, puts it,
perfect affinity is found only at the octave (Micrologus, ch. 8). Thus, it
seems to me that hexachordal solmization designates the *size* or *species*
of intervals, but remains quite vague as to whether for example two mi-fa
intervals in a diatonic piece are a fourth, a fifth, or an octave apart
(nor, I would argue, was it ever its function to be specific about that),
particularly so if we accept that mi-fa was mentally processed as part of a
hexachord.  I am convinced that these diatonic areas between the various
mi-fa -- expressed more correctly, or perhaps more directly, by the system
of seven letters or by an heptachord-based solmization system -- were
relevant and meaningful to medieval and Renaissance musicians listeners as
part of an undivided diatonic continuum, rather than as broken space to be
constantly mediated by mutations.
        A recent study by Prof. Thomas Brothers expresses, I believe,
similar views.  He writes: "[Late medieval] theorists routinely refer to
accidentals in terms of solmization syllables, and this may seem to confirm
the hexachordal significance of the signs.  Yet it is clear that
solmization syllables could serve merely as a shorthand way of identifying
intervals and not necessarily as markers of hexachords" (*Chromatic Beauty
in the Late Medieval Chanson,* [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1997]), p. 42.  Prof. Brothers discusses one case in which the use of a
flat in key signature DOES indicate unequivocally the _fa_ of a (D)
hexachord, but concludes that this particular "usage is so isolated that it
is difficult to accept it as an indication that *all* accidentals have
hexachordal implications" (p. 41, emphasis in the text).
        I personally could not agree more with these conclusions.

NM:4. Hexachordal perception as local perception. If you can deduce the final
cadence of a work from its opening gesture, it certainly is the result of
an acculturation (I mean, you seem to be refering to chant formulas, which
obviously belong to your musical culture);

RK:  Doesn't most performance practice and analysis incorporate
acculturation?  For example:  Lakewood and Johnson's  "universal focal red"
has no aural equivalent.  People with AP develop it at the pitch of their
culture; most have difficulty adjusting it longterm? There isn't an
equivalent "universal aural Bb" although there may well be one in 20 years
from the infl. of cheap tuners, world music and MTV?

NM: Similarly, hexachordal usage, species of 5ths and 4ths, the tenor,
the first phrase, and so on, may allow to classify the piece in a given
mode, but we still don't know how, nor even, in the case of Renaissance
polyphony, _whether_ we perceive the mode. This is the core of the
discussion between Bernhard Meier and Dahlhaus:. . .

RK: Yet another dumb question to those on the list who know--did Meier and
Dahlhaus develop their theories on a basis of regular performance first,
followed by analysis--as seems to have been the case for most theorists at
least up to 1600--or the inverse:  analysis followed by performance?

RK:I don't have data, just personal experience.  I grew up in a rural pt.
of US, much of time w/o electricity, radio, reordings, TV, movies, etc. At
age 9 I had a HUGE argument with my  first piano teacher over her first
scale assignment:  I didn't like the sound of major and wanted to flat all
7ths.  I didn't know that was Mixolydian, just that it sounded better.
Returning to the area  as an adult, I've recorded versions of Child ballads
not in Bronson's collection. The scalar structure of my childhood
compatriots has changed to M-m with the last 40-50 years of influence of
outside music?

NM:,snip> you seem to be refering to chant formulas, which
obviously belong to your musical culture. . .

RK:  I'm not referring to chant, but rather to the 15th-16th-some early &
conservative 17th literature I've played & sung most of my life?  I know of
no study supporting this, (someone may and it may be contradictory but I'd
love to know?) but I have a sense that madrigals/motets opening in Mode V,
as defined by tenor or possibly later cantus? will rarely move out of mode
to Mode VII in their interior, while the inverse:  opening in Mode VII and
going out of mode to V, might not seem so surprising?

RK: Consider  the the modal and stylistic differences between Arcadelt's
Fr. Chansons and It. madrigals?  When I sing/play them, not only does their
ctptal texture and ornamentation of line seem at different points on the
musical continuum, also I expect different modal usage?  This doesn't arise
from formal analytical notes, just years of singing/playing in consorts?

RK: Both D.L. and Libby Larsen, among other US contemporary
composers/theorists, grew up as children singing lots of chant (on a daily
basis--D.L--as I remember from one of your articles re voice changing thru
parts?)

NM:. . . what you do is that you identify the mode. But is solmization as
such concerned with that?. Singing solmization syllables tells you which
are the intervals surrounding the note you sing, but not what kind of
mutation will follow.

RK:  I'm not sure?  If for example an unknown (by me) pre-tonal work opens
w/ some variant of the common "lick"  ut-re-fa-re, I hear/sing/play it as
exactly that and assume an opening in Mode I.   I'll expect, esp. if it's
16th c., to cadence a lot on F and A.  . As a contrary example, if it opens
with a descending "lick" of la(D)-sol(C)-mi(a)-back up to sol(C), I'll
expect more Mode II, more interior cadences on F than A?

 Solmizing off my hand held in front of the music notation as I've done for
20+ yrs, I'm going to read ahead and decide by the resolution of any
subsequent pitch "B" whether it's B fa or mi, and whether it simply exceeds
the hexachord or moves out of mode?  I'll expect either Mode I or II to end
with a D as the tenor finalis, and if it doesn't, question if the work is
complete or a fragment?  The neat thing about solmizing off my hand is how
my sense of touch and direction starts to lead my voice, as well as making
me read ahead for necessary mutations?  My students report the same thing
in only a semester's use?

NM:7. "Truth"? Never heard of such a thing. Didn't Popper state that the only
thing that is sure about scientific theories, is that they eventually will
be proved false?

RK:  To misquote a story of two Philadelphia members of the Society of
Friends:  "Thou and I agree on this point, but I do sometime wonder at the
rest of humanity. And there be times that I do wonder about even thee and
me?"

In answer to (some of) Rosemary Killam's comments and questions. (The
points that I do not comment are those on which I have no opinion -- or at
least no informed one.)

1. Notes having two hexachordal functions at the same time. It is true that
any note serving as a mutation point has two hexachordal functions, but,
conceptually at least, these follow each other. The case that Prof.
Mengozzi pointed is that of a note belonging to two polyphonic parts at the
same time and having a different function in each. This is the case with
the D in the left hand, m. 8 of fugue 5 in WTCII, which is a FA in the bass
part and an UT in the tenor part.

2. Was solmization one of the reasons that keyboard music was written in
tablature? Yes, I think so. Staff notation is more a notation of intervals
than of pitches, and keyboardists really needed to read pitches, not
intervals. Note, by the way, that a change of clefs when reading a score
reduces to a change of hexachords (an UT on the line of the clef is a C-UT
in C-clef, a G-UT in G-clef, an F-UT in F-clef). This has direct
consequences on how transposition was conceived; to keyboardists, it may
have been an advantage and/or a drawback, depending on the circumstances.

3. Establishment of the mode of a polyphonic work. There are two issues
here, as with modern tonality: one is of knowing in what key or mode a
piece is (i.e., a matter of classification), the other of knowing HOW it is
in that key or mode (a matter of perception). The fact that Bach's fugue
under discussion bears number 5 in the WTC allows us to classify it in D
major as surely as if Bach had labeled it "Fugue in D major". But David
Lewin's question is "how do we know, how do we perceive that it is in D
major?" Similarly, hexachordal usage, species of 5ths and 4ths, the tenor,
the first phrase, and so on, may allow to classify the piece in a given
mode, but we still don't know how, nor even, in the case of Renaissance
polyphony, _whether_ we perceive the mode. This is the core of the
discussion between Bernhard Meier and Dahlhaus: is modality something
belonging to the inner structure of the piece, or merely something
external? Or, as Powers puts the question: is mode a pre-compositional
category? And the question implicitly asked by David Lewin is similar.

4. Hexachordal perception as local perception. If you can deduce the final
cadence of a work from its opening gesture, it certainly is the result of
an acculturation (I mean, you seem to be refering to chant formulas, which
obviously belong to your musical culture); what you do is that you identify
the mode. But is solmization as such concerned with that?. Singing
solmization syllables tells you which are the intervals surrounding the
note you sing, but not what kind of mutation will follow. To take an
example in a totally different context, when in anhemitonic pentatonic
music you hear the characteristic interval of the "augmented second", you
know the intervals closely surrounding it, but you don't know at what
distance the other augmented second will be within the octave, whether it
will be a 4th or a 5th higher or lower. The uncertainty, more generally, is
whether the next trichord, tetrachord, hexachord or whatever, will be
conjunct or disjunct. Note that the first mode, in the middle ages, can be
formed either of conjunct or of disjunct hexachords -- which is another way
of saying that it can include either the B flat or the B natural. The
hexachordal structure does not determine the mode.

5. Our work on the French system. Our intention is to publish an article,
which I hope may be ready within weeks or a few months at most. It will
then be proposed to one of the (few) French journals, probably *Musurgia*,
where it may appear, say, in 1999 or 2000. In the meanwhile, I'll be ready
to answer specific questions.

6. The term "Lancashire system" is given, without explanation, in S.
Kleinman, *La solmisation mobile de Jean-Jacques Rousseau a John Curwen*,
Paris, 1974.

7. "Truth"? Never heard of such a thing. Didn't Popper state that the only
thing that is sure about scientific theories, is that they eventually will
be proved false?

Just a few notes about some recent comments on Morley, which I hope are not
getting too far off topic.

At 07:03 PM 9/7/98 -0700, Rosemary Killam wrote:
>Again NM=Prof. Meeus; RK=Rosemary Killam

EC: I will re-paste the whole quote here, since I didn't respond when NM
originally posted it: "Now to sing your notes, you cannot use the words
GAMUT, Are, etc., they being too long; therefore their meaning is
contracted to these several short syllables, Sol, La, Mi, Fa; Ut and Re
being left out, and are with less Confusion supplied with Sol, and La. It
was the Ancient Practice [Morley, or Playford, probably means: to sing six
syllables], and the French generally use it now, but this Modern Way [i.e.
of singing four syllables only] is found less difficult to the young
practicioner".

This quote is not actually from Morley.  Perhaps the closest he comes is: 

Ma. Take this for a general rule, that in one deduction of the six notes,
you can have one name but once used, although indeed (if you could keep
right tune) it were no matter how you named any note.  But this we use

never use ut.
Phi. How then? Do you never sing ut but in Gam ut?
Ma. Not so: But if either Gam ut, or C fa ut, or F fa ut, or G sol re ut,
be the lowest note of the part, then we may sing ut there.

Jessie Ann Owens's recent article, "Concepts of Pitch in English Music
Theory, c.1560-1640" in _Tonal Structures in Early Music_, ed. Cristle
Collins Judd (NY: Garland, 1998) discusses this question at length and very
lucidly.  The English system (imperfectly represented by Morley) was indeed
distinct from the traditional continental one.

I think this may be a bit of an exaggeration: although Morley was not
trained in one of the old religious foundations, he surely studied with
people who were, or were at any rate trained according to the old
traditions.  As far as I know there have been no better suggestions than
Shaw's that he was a chorister at Norwich.  (If I am missing something,
someone please tell me!)  The music training there and elsewhere surely did
not come to a sudden halt; Morley would have been a child in the early
1560s, not long after Elizabeth assumed the throne and re-established
Protestantism.  Remember, too, that at this point nobody knew she was going
to live so long and that this change would last; many people hoped or
feared that Catholicism would be back any minute.

My own hypothesis, though this is getting farther away from Bach, is that a
practical, oral tradition of theory may have grown up in England, largely
isolated from the international written tradition.  I think of it as
analogous to the difference between the "classical" theory I learned and
the "guitar theory" that my stepson is learning as a performer: so many
terms and concepts overlap that it appears at first to be the same system,
but when you get down to details you find that it really is not.  My
hypothesis is that Morley was attempting to reconcile these two systems
(oral and written) without being entirely clear on the difficulties and
inconsistencies in doing this.  Those who followed him made the
distinctions a bit clearer.  

I would very much welcome any thoughts that anyone has on this subject --
privately would be fine, since they are getting farther away from the topic
under discussion here.

DL:      [1] I'm not sure what Prof. Killam means by a "comparative table
>of subjects for JSB's WTC I and II."  What sort of "comparison" is meant?

RK:  I was thinking ore of the sort of graph I have somewhere, that I
should put into an edb, from the days when I taught 15-18 hrs/wk & had to
be able to come up with comparable examples in a hurry?  Someplace I've a
2-dimensional graph listing each fugue by length of subject,
characterization of answer, meter, number of  subsequent appearances of
subject, number of mod/non-mod sequences & 4-5 other characteristics.  I've
the same for the 2-vc. inventions, and lists for the JSB chorale settings:
(exs:  chorales with: no modulations, 4 phrases only, ending in imperfect
authentic cadences, borrowed/mixed mode harmony--the sort of lists I guess
we've all made at one time or another during enforced quiet such as
hospital stays? Such handy for lesson planning, but only  suggestions
toward analyses?

DL:       [2] In paragraph [14] of my response to Meeus I try to "compare"
>various subjects more technically, in the ways they seem to me variously
>to "indicate" or "propose" (Marpurg's "anzeigen") their keys.  Is this
>perhaps the sort of thing Killam has in mind?

RK:  I was thinking far more superficially?

DL:   [3] Killam's remarks about Walther . . .I should draw attention here to
. . . stressing the fact that Marpurg (who ought to be speaking with
authority) >considers the subject of the DM fugue from Book II to be
_abnormal_, warning students away from it.

RK:  Good point--but should there perhaps be a corollary to Boorstin's
Law": "History belongs to the winners" of, "and to the writers?"  Is one of
our problems with analyzing JSB  the relative lack of treatises written by
him or his contemporaries, and the plethora of treatises written by his
students and his children?

DL:   The best way to learn to read Fraktur, I think, is to practice
>writing Schrift.  It doesn't take long to get the hang of it, and one gets
>a fair amount of enjoyment from the calligraphy. . . .

RK:  Ach, David, I'm gonna have to live to at least 120 to meet your
minimum standards of scholarship?

Re Prof. Dineen's ref. to Brown & Butler's work on the perceptual/cognitive
nature of tonally-defining tritones (suppored theoretically by Ratner):
their work presumes 20th c. listeners.  David B, Helen B, how comfortable
are you with extending your findings back three centuries?  Best, Rosemary

Re Solmization:

Ref Prof. Mengozzi's first segment on the meaning of "re-mi":  perhaps I'm
not reading deeply enough into his argument, but the consistency and
importance of "mi-fa" as a half step throughout the historical use of
solmization seems the more important and basic?  "Mi-fa" generalizes
outside JSB's usage and was one of the points on which all of the
solmization texts and practices agreed?

Re Prof. Dineen's commentaries--

Would members of the MTO-list conside rposting their favorite citations
(preferably recent) on comparisons/contrasts within the whole of WTCI and
WTCII?  Obviously, WTCII has less variety of voices--no 2- or 5-vc. fugues
& as I recall, a difference of some 20 yrs. between completion of the
volumes.  I'm working from a deficit of knowledge, which many of you have?

Would JSB have changed/reworked his use of modes/hexachords between the two
volumes, as per the paper from someone at the Goethe Institute, given at
the Van Couver meeting, showing a definite change in JSB's  4-vc. chorale
cadence writing, ~1728, as I recall?

The only possible analogy I can make is to those early chorale preludes
rediscovered in the Yale lib. by Wolff in the mid-80's.  I've checked the
underlying key/mode of those c.p's with JSB's chorale settings of the same
melodies, datable from the Leipzig period and contained in cantatas--not
just individual chorale settings.. The interior key/mode relationships of
those I've checked remain the same between c.p.s and chorales, even when a
more "tonal" choice for the later chorales was available, logical and
possibly more in JSB's "later" harmonic styles.

 Tentative conclusion?  JSB harmonized the chorale melodies, whether as
highly figured c.p.'s or relatively simple 4-vc. chorales, from a
pre-existant interior  harmonic  concept, certainly not dictated by any
agreement with or among the many chorale books he owned?

Can such a tentative conclusion be expanded to other segments of JSB's
sacred works?  Can it, possibly, be expanded to his secular works, such as
the WTCI and II.  As someone who studied WTCI & II, (preludes esp. but w/
some ref to the fugues) for their dance form derivations (hey, Dan
Harrison?  who else amongst us did this at Stanford?) I wonder what other
influences on JSB's fugal writing I'm missing?  With curiosity, Rosemary

It may be relevant to add to the discussion around David Lewin's paper
about the WTC II-5 D major Fugue subject the following two points. 1. A
recently developed computational key-finding model, the Parallel Processing
Model, PPM (Vos & Van Geenen, Music perception, 1996, vol 14, pp 185-224),
tested with all WTK fugue themes, came also up with G major in this case,
and a perceptual test of PPM's  plausibility (same article) showed that
listeners interpreted the subject unequivocally as G. 2. Recently, I
discovered the origin of the exceptionality (Vos, "Tonal implications of
ascending fourth and descending fifth openings", submitted to Psychology of
Music). Since the latter paper is still under review, I delay its content
here, but interested collegues may consult my homepage in which the
discovery is essentially formulated as a rule).

NM:>1. David Lewin is right that issues of solmization may be conceptualized
>quite differently in French and in English/German. It is a problem of which
>we have been aware in Paris, when working on solmization last year:

RK:  Your work on the French system has yielded results I've been hoping
for, for years.  I assume both indirect & indirect infl. on Boulanger and
her teachers' methods of solfege?  Where have you reported your findings,
and how can we all get copies, please?


NM:. Let me quote Thomas Morley (1597; I quote the Playford edition
>of 1730): "Now to sing your notes, you cannot use the words GAMUT, Are,
>etc., . . . [This system apparently sometimes has been called the
>"Lancashire >system": does anyone have information about that?]

RK:  I don't know the term "Lancashire system", but Morley's solmization
system was quite atypical for his time in England. (I did a bit of work on
this some year ago, superseded by others I'm sure, who will update the
following?)

RK1.   I think of the "Lancashire system" as named the "fa-sol-la" system?.
In part its use can be traced (and more perhaps inferred) thru the
excellent pay records of the English  church, court and town musicians--who
sang what where and with whom, born, educated, died when and where?

RK2.  Morley appears to have been the first English composer/writer on
solmization who was not taught it as a child through a religious
foundation, since those were dissolved by Henry VIII before his childhood
studies began.  Therefore, he wrote of a system which he personally hadn't
learned.

RK3.  Morley's writings coincided w/ heavy English Migration to N. Am, and
N.A.influenced music publication and solmization treatises often inserted
w/ music.  What is the relationship of European Fr. practices to those
established and maintained in  Fr. Canadian music studies and religious
schools/foundations?

RK:  Finally, my problem with incorporation of Schoenberg, Schenker,
Schillenger, into a "belief system" of music theory:  Isn't "truth" partial
and subject to change with new information?  Do we denigrate Rutherford
because we've refined the speed of light multiple times, or Curie because
of our expanded experience with radium? Whatever my respect for B.C.E.
Greek philosophers, I wouldn't want them prescribing my medical treatment?
How do we continue to respect work of previous theorists without deifying
them and canonizing their findings, yet incorporate their knowledge into
our current (& everchanging) concepts of music theory?

Will someone whose specialties include theories of colonial Am. music
comment on late use of hexachordal mutation in compositions and theoretical
treatises by composers such as Daniel Read, esp. in light of Read's
late-in-lifeconfessions that he didn't understand how to write in the "new
scientific method"?  All of his music I've studied keeps melody in tenor?

Hexachordal/septachordal scales and treatises used to teach music in the
early 18th c. Am. Revival are a mixed lot, with wide influence.  Memory
fails, but I hink Gay's 1728 Beggar's Opera, with its many modal-infl
melodies, was performed on most of the New World opera circuits as well as
English colonies on other continents before death of JSB, Handel, D.
Scarlatti?  (One of the standard "why don't polar bears eat penguins"
questions we've all asked our classes?  Why weren't JSB Chorale setting
included in the early NA Colonial Psalmbooks?--music composition, history,
theory & performance are a lot more historically mixed than 20th c.
elementary theory texts tend to present?)

Also, what of 17th-18th c. compositional schools and treatises dealing with
hexachordal performance/compositional usage,  surrounding cathedrals of
Mexico City, Santa Fe, and CA Missions?  Hasn't recent research shown this
music to have more reciprocal European influence than previously believed,
rather than being just derivative offshoot?  Don't some of the 17th c.
dance forms and harmoniec structures seem now to have New World origin, in
part?

I've been doing specialized reading on perception/cognition for past
several years & am behind in areas above.  What are y'all's standard
reference articles, books on hexachordal-modal-tonal theories, published in
the last 5 years?  Thanks, Rosemary

from Prof Meeus, subsequent NM; comments, Rosemary Killam subsequent RK:
NM:>Stefano Mengozzi makes the most interesting point that solmization may not
>have been very practical when reading polyphonic music polyphonically --
it may have two hexachordal functions at the same time.

RK:  I need to reread Stefano M's point, but does not any note serving as a
mutation point have two hexachordal functions?

NM:  specifically, it must have been quite uncomfortable for keyboardists.

RK:  Was this one of the reasons that so much early kb music was written in
tableture (forgive me, all, please?  My spelling is  poor. Spellcheck on
Eudora Pro is rudimentary--I need to expand, but it's far down the list of
"To Do's". Any solutions so that y'all don't have to wince at my
misspellings?--I save/n/send all docs but email thru a much better
Spellcheck?)
RK:  Wild guess--would the prob. of multiple functioning of notes in
hexachords have been a partial reason that so many blind musicians were
trained to be organists, who would handle reading/memorization quite
differently than sighted musicians?  I'll cc email this for commentary  to
an organist friend who specializes in Fr. repertoire?

NM:>The situation was different, of course, for singers or players of monodic
>instruments when they read only one part. These, in the Middle Ages and the
>early Renaissance at least, must have conceived the diatonic space as a
>complex concatenation of hexachords (rather than a simple concatenation of
>octaves).

RK:  Also 20th c. ones?  After  years of performance, the modal 5ths, 4ths
& relationship hexachords including transposed ones, I find that I consider
octaves as resultant rather than causal in interpretation?

RK:  Horseley's position was that hexachordal usage, combined w/ modal 5ths
& 4ths, est'd the mode of a polyphonic work, determined primarily by tenor,
all the more strictly when correlated w/ date of compositions/1st
performances? Most 3- & >3&vc. polyphony  was written w/ 2 voices in modal
pairs?   Performers grasp(ed) the mode from the first phrase?  As one who
has sung/played this literature, I've found her methodology practical and
persuasive.  To what extent has her research been superseded?

RK:  Yet another silly question:  the mathematical possibilities  for
equivalent acceptable vertical sonorities vary with the placement of the
melody in tenor or later in cantus--what is a simple arithmetic statement
of that relationship?

NM:
>A hexachordal perception (or a tetrachordal one, for that matter) is
>characterized by the importance given to very local events;

RK:  As a performer of the music, I question this?  If the incipit I'm
playing opens with the "mi-mi" 5th, I have a VERY good idea of the final
cadence, as well as significant tones within the composition.  Should a
section of the work move to "re-fa-sol-la" in the c.f. or as a melody
underlying ornamentation, I'll expect that segment to have a different
intent and interpretive needs?

NM: because it imposes a mutation "in the air", so to
>speak, i.e. between notes rather than on one note that would assume two
>functions in succession.

RK:  Isn't there a case to be made for the influence of the acoustical
space of the area performance area intended?  Small spaces with shorter
reverb times supported  clear chromaticism, and the inverse.  Romanesque
and Gothic architecture of large spaces support different overtones in
their reverbs.  I'm not suggesting that every harried composer of yet one
more setting for the next feast took this into conscious account, but until
the time of the international movement of composers during their
compositional lifetimes, most composers wrote for specific spaces and
fairly specific ensembles, with their group strengths & weaknesses.  Also,
musical vibration remained a part of the core education into the 16th c.?

	[1] I'm not sure what Prof. Killam means by a "comparative table
of subjects for JSB's WTC I and II."  What sort of "comparison" is meant?
If it is simply a matter of displaying the individual subjects in musical
notation, one after another, then such displays can be found in the Henle
("Urtext") edition -- listing the subjects for Book I at the beginning of
that volume, and then the subjects for Book II at the beginning of _that_
volume.  I imagine there are other editions that have such lists.  

	[2] In paragraph [14] of my response to Meeus I try to "compare"
various subjects more technically, in the ways they seem to me variously
to "indicate" or "propose" (Marpurg's "anzeigen") their keys.  Is this
perhaps the sort of thing Killam has in mind?  If so, I think one learns a
lot more by going through the subject of each fugue for oneself, and then
trying to summarize ones findings in ones own terms, than one learns by
inspecting a table drawn up by somebody else, on the basis of that other
person's thinking and hearing.

	[3] Killam's remarks about Walther are excellent and suggestive in
the context of my article and Meeus's response (and my subsequent response
to him).  By way of caution, though, I should draw attention here to
paragraphs [4] and [5] of my response to Meeus -- stressing the fact that
Marpurg (who ought to be speaking with authority) considers the subject of
the DM fugue from Book II to be _abnormal_, warning students away from it.
So far as what Bach's contemporaneous and/or personal "norms" might have
been, I have relied on Prof. Wolff's expertise, feeling that I have very
little myself.

	[4] The best way to learn to read Fraktur, I think, is to practice
writing Schrift.  It doesn't take long to get the hang of it, and one gets
a fair amount of enjoyment from the calligraphy.  It also helps one read a
fair amount of handwritten material from the 19th and
first-half-of-the-20th centuries-- though some people were such slobs that
their particular hands remain undecipherable except through long and
sustained study.  Besides, it's a vanishing art and should be kept alive
if only by artificial respiration.  German students no longer learn to
write Schrift, and many have  trouble reading it.  In 1991 I was standing
in front of Brecht's theater, where there was a poster announcing a future
production of "die Dreigroschenoper," that title being written in Schrift.
A couple of college-age German students were standing  next to me, and one
had to ask the other what the words were -- even in _that_ milieu!

Subject: Re: Meeus's reply to my fugue article
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
X-UIDL: 74ab6fc9b282e75928a96be2423b475b

	[1] Thanks to Nicolas Meeus for his lively interest in my Bach
fugue article, and for his many suggestive and informative remarks.
	
	[2] In my article, I meant to propose Issues (A) and (B) below for
consideration.
		Issue A: How might  _I_ (DL), in my own historical -
cultural context, be able to hear the subject of this particular fugue (in
itself, as a rhetorical "proposition") to be "based on D" in some sense,
rather than "based on G"?<NOTE 1> 
		Issue B: Is it conceivable that _Bach_, in _his_
historical - cultural context, might have listened to the subject in a
manner related, in some way, to the mode-of-listening I find suggestive as
I respond to Issue A?

	[3] In approaching those issues, I do not feel that historical
norms from 17th and 18th century France can offer decisive assistance,
though the story of their development is important and interesting.  As
Nicolas points out himself, his "...  information concerning Germany
probably is incomplete ... ."  In this regard I have relied for advice on
Professor Wolff, being myself quite hopelessly inexpert on such matters.  

	[4] But there is a more general problem, in an appeal to
contemporaneous historical norms of _any_ sort.  The problem is that
Bach's treatment of the subject-and-answer, in this fugue, was considered
to be _abnormal_ by such a sympathetic contemporary and follower as
Marpurg.  My quotations from Marpurg were not just for local flavor.  The
point is that Marpurg finds Bach's procedure inexplicable, and
specifically warns students away from it.  And Marpurg is not just any old
writer, in this connection.  His _Abhandlung_ was the definitive text on
fugue-writing for German readers for many years -- indeed Schenker's
article on the c minor fugue from Book I specifically
cites Marpurg, and treats Marpurg with respect.<NOTE 2>  Marpurg's
acquaintance with German 18th-century theory and theorists was certainly
much more than adequate.  Reference to the critical literature will make
that very clear. <NOTE 3>  Then, too, Marpurg was regarded in his own time
as a particular authority on the practice of J.S. Bach.  The heirs of
Bach, for example, asked Marpurg to write the preface for _The Art of the
Fugue_, upon the first publication of that composition.

	[5] So if Marpurg was unable to find, in the canonical music
theory of his own time and place, a theoretical reason for the behavior of
Bach's fugue subject,  I doubt that we shall do much better by searching
that and other canons ourselves.  It seems to me that, in approaching
Issue B above, we must take note of such canons insofaras they might have
been _influencing_ the ways in which Bach heard and thought about what he
was doing -- e.g. providing terminology and syntax within which he might
have been formulating his musical and intellectual ideas.  On the other
hand, I do not see that we can suppose he was _obeying_ some particular
canon of the sort -- in that case, Marpurg would surely have had more to
say on the particular subject. <NOTE 4>

	[6]  The French convention of "the last SI," that Nicolas
discusses, is very interesting, but again it does not seem quite to
address the Issues of paragraph [2] above.  It certainly tells one how to
_perform_ solf'ege, given a score.  But it does not address how to
solf'ege what one _hears without looking at a score_ -- a matter central
to my Issue A.  Nor does it address how to solf'ege a tune one is
_composing_, in particular what key signature to visualize -- a matter
central to my Issue B.  So Nicolas's remark, that "the C sharp in the
signature would have determined the first D to be read UT ...," is
somewhat beside the point: Bach _wrote_ the signature; he didn't "read"
it; I used to _hear_ the theme "in G," without visualizing either a
one-sharp or a two-sharp signature as I was listening in my imagination.
(At least so I believe in reminiscence.)  I should say that I am not
opposed to the idea of "Augenmusik" as such, but I don't think it
approaches Issues B or A very adequately here.

	[7]  Nicolas thinks I seem confused, when I ask "Was UT a pitch
class for Bach, in the way that DO is for us in modern solf'ege?"  He goes
on to talk about fixed-DO versus moveable-DO, as if this were the issue.
I did not mean to create that impression.  What I meant was that for us, a
"DO" is a "DO" in any register.  So, e.g., in singing up a major scale, we
will solf'ege DO-RE-MI-FA-SOL-LA-SI-DO, giving the high DO at the end of
the performance the same syllable as the low DO at the beginning.  A
hexachordal performance might, however, proceed as
UT-RE-MI-FA-SOL-RE-MI-FA, or as UT-RE-MI-FA-UT-RE-MI-FA.<NOTE 5>  Other
sorts of mutation are possible under other mutational conventions, and
that issue is quite complex, especially spread over history and geography.
Regardless of the particular mutation used, though, the highest
hexachordal note would always be a FA, because the semitone at the high
end of this passage would have to be a MI-FA (there being no SI in the
hexachordal picture).  Thus from a hexachordal point of view, the octave
above the low UT of this (complete) scale would be not an
UT-in-a-different-register, but a FA.  So "UT" is not a pitch class in
_that_ sense: if one sings a note as hexachord-UT, and then sings a note
an octave higher, the higher note will be not an UT, but some other _vox_.
(In case we are imagining filling in a complete major heptachord, the
_vox_ must be a FA; if we do not fill in the complete modern-major scale,
the _vox_ might be something else -- e.g. a SOL of the plagally related
hexachord, as I suggest in my article.)  In contrast, if we sing a DO in
modern solf'ege and then sing a note an octave higher, we will sing it as
DO, whether or not we are mentally supplying the filling-in of the octave
through a major scale.  In this connection, it is irrelevant whether we
are using "fixed DO" or "movable DO."  [Hexachordal] "UT," in sum, means
not a note some number of octaves away from a given "UT", but rather a
note at the bottom of some (any) pertinent hexachord.

	[8]  That is what I was getting at in the way I was mulling over
my "unmutated" and "mutated" versions of Bach's theme.  I like very much
Nicolas's discussion of the problems they raise, which engage from his
point of view my questions as to whether a C-or-C# is "missing," or rather
whether we may not be in some sort of _musica recta_ situation, where
either C or C# is equally available, but equally non-obligatory.<NOTE 6>
I am not sure, though, in what sense "a true hexachordal reading
necessarily implies a (missing) C NATURAL, instead of a C sharp."  The
"implication" seems to be the rather Schenkerian idea that a leap somehow
implies all the passing tones that fill it in diatonically (here, within
the pertinent hexachord).  I wonder to what extent hexachordal _voces_ (in
this or that historical period and place -- or in Bach's own ear) can be
supposed to behave in that fashion.<NOTE 7>

	[9] In his second posting, Nicolas follows this up very
brilliantly, by suggesting: "should one not wonder whether avoiding the
7th degree is not a "mixolydian" gesture ... ?"  The idea occurred to me
too, as I was pondering Nicolas's first posting.  It makes me think of a
topic covered by Lori Burns, in her study of Bach's harmonizations for
"modal" chorale melodies. <NOTE 8>  Not infrequently, as she observes, one
finds some harmonization of a Mixolydian melody as if it were in modern
major -- in which case Bach generally writes the extra sharp in the key
signature (e.g. one sharp for "G major").  And not infrequently too, one
finds another harmonization of the same melody as if it were in a strict
Mixolydian mode -- in which case Bach generally writes one less sharp in
the key signature (e.g. no accidentals for "G Mixolydian").  At times it
is difficult, even within one particular harmonization, to pin the
modality down to "modern major" or "Mixolydian," and it is not always
clear why the key signature has one more or one less accidental.  The
behavior that Burns describes, vis-'a-vis chorale harmonization, seems to
resonate very well with the idea of Bach's leaving the 7th degree out of
his fugue subject at its initial appearance.

	[10] I am moving on now, generally, to Nicolas's second posting.
Nicolas states my positions too strongly when he refers to my assumptions,
past and present.  The title of my article has a question mark at the end
of it, and I put it there with some deliberation.  So I wouldn't say that
the title of my article makes "evident" my "more general assumption" that
"tonality, in general, is a matter of the saturation of a 'tonal space' of
some kind."  Indeed the question-mark of the title hedges my bets even as
specifically regards the subject of the fugue under discussion.  The title
means to suggest something like this: Do we get a sense, in "The D Major
Fugue Subject from WTC II," that some sort of metaphorical space is being
"saturated"?   The title is _not_ "Tonality as Spatial Saturation."  I
cannot imagine ever wanting to write such an article.  Nor is the title
even "Spatial Saturation in the Subject of the D Major Fugue ... "
Rather, the title points to the D major fugue-subject from WTCII, and then
_asks_, "Spatial Saturation?"  My intent was not to prove anything about
how one "ought to" hear the tune (much less about The Nature of Tonality),
but rather to stimulate thought and listening among readers -- exactly the
sorts of thought and listening that Nicolas's remarks exemplify.

	[11] In referring to my "covert assumption that traditional
Tonality is expressed by exposing a complete diatonic gamut," I meant to
indicate that my assumption had not been conscious, that it had made me
think of C-or-C# as somehow "missing," and that it had led me to think in
ways I later considered inadequate, when I listened to and analyzed the
opening of the fugue.  Far from trying to promulgate this "covert
assumption," I meant to _repudiate it_ as  a generality about Tonality,
and even to suggest repudiating it as an aid for analyzing the fugue
subject.  (I think I sense that Nicolas is less willing than I am, to "let
go" of the "missing" C-or-C#.)

	[12] I quoted from Schoenberg because he was an influential source
for me at an early age.  Surely we should regard Schoenberg's ideas with
respect and interest, however we come to modify or reject this or that one
over the course of our lives.  I am now 65 years old, and have been
teaching music theory -- at undergraduate and graduate levels -- for
thirty-seven years; I have changed my attitudes to a number of things that
profoundly influenced me from fifty-five to forty-eight years ago, though
I think it would be _falsch_  to pretend to myself, that by modifying my
attitudes I have completely freed myself from such influences.
Schoenberg's own idea about diatonic "saturation" is still interesting for
me, not only because Schoenberg himself is, and because his music is as
thrillingly compelling for me as ever, but also because the idea I quoted
interacts for me in a suggestive way with Schoenberg's involvement in
total chromaticism.  

	[13] All that said, it is manifest that many of Bach's fugue
subjects (for keyboard in particular) _do_ "define the key" in some way,
and that the subject for the DM fugue of WTCII is quite unusual in that
regard, not only because it does not  adequately "define the key (of D)"
but even more because it ambivalently suggests a different key.  The
quotation from Marpurg speaks directly to those points -- and refers
specifically to a "rule that requires a fugue theme to indicate the key
unambiguously ([eine] Regel, welche einen deutlichen und die Tonart
gehoerig anzeigenden Fugensatz erfordert)."

	[14] Well, how _does_ a typical (Bach) fugue subject  "indicate
the key"?  I do not see any easy generalization on this.  In some cases
one particular diminshed interval seems to be sufficient.  I am thinking
of the c#m fugue in BookI; the remarks on diatonic tritones  in Note 2 of
my article seem also appropriate in this regard -- e.g. the E#-B in the
d#m fugue of BookI "indicates the key" of its RE, d#, even though the B
must be solf'eged as a "FA super LA."  In some cases, a hexachord seems
sufficient in itself (CM Book I, DM Book I).  In some cases a complete
major or minor heptachord of some species -- allowing "harmonic minor" --
is presented (cm BookI, C#M Book I, dm Book 1).  And so forth.  Other
cases seem mixed: for example, the EbM fugue in Book I first presents the
complete Eb hexachord, and then modulates to present the complete BbM
scale.  Here the _low_ UT at the beginning seems important, in its
capacity as the low note of its hexachord (and of the subject); by the
time we get to what _would_ be a "SI" in Eb major, we are hearing the tone
as a MI, not a SI.  The example nicely illustrates Nicolas's law of "the
last SI":  A-natural, in the middle of the subject, pre-empts the SI
function from the later D.

	[15] In this context I do not find it farfetched to think that
_one_ of Bach's devices, for "indicating a major key" via a fugue subject,
is to expose the hexachord of which the tonic is the low UT.  And such an
exposition is indeed manifest in the DM fugue subject of BookII, once we
are past its problematical opening leap.  That noted, all sorts of
solf'ege questions and complications come into the picture, as I suggested
and as Nicolas has discussed in great detail at greater length.

	[16] Nicolas refers to a D hexachord, transposed beyond the C, F,
and G hexachords, as "a concept utterly foreign to medieval solmization."
This is not much to the point as regards Bach's practice.  The Hughes
article on Solmization in _The New Grove_ (cited in NOTE 5 of the present
document) includes discussion of "ficta hexachords" during the
Renaissance, necessitated by solmizing conventions observed in Ockeghem's
_Missa Mi-mi_, and other such compositions (p.462).

	[17] "My own view of tonality is that it is never decisively
determined.  Tonality is a dynamic process; it builds up ...  I believe
that a tonality can never be established in a few notes or a few measures.
. tonal compositions often begin with a weak statement of the tonality,
a statement that is late confirmed, then put to test."  Well, yes; sure.
We are living after Hegel, Moritz Hauptmann, and Schenker.  But Bach was
living before them.  In Nicolas's observations above, I think the key word
is "established," and I think its source, in his discourse, is my
Schoenberg quotation -- or rather the title of the section in the
_Harmonielehre_  ("Establishment of Tonality") from which the quotation
comes.    

	[18] Rather than "_inidicating_ a key" (my translation of
Marpurg's "[eine Tonart] anzeigen") or "Establishing a Tonality"
(Schoenberg), I suggest here that a Bach fugue subject typically
"proposes" a key.  I like that term better than Nicolas's idea of
beginning with a "weak statement".  "Weak" carries unfortunate
metaphorical baggage in this context -- one wouldn't want to begin
performing a piece with the idea that there is something "weak" about the
music one is playing.  The idea that a Bach subject "proposes" a key fits
in well with the ideas and categories of rhetoric, and the term is not
very far from a possible alternate translation of Marpurg's "anzeigen."
The problem at hand, then, is that theSubject of the fugue under
discussion seems either to propose a key of G that is not later confirmed
(even and particularly by the real Answer!), or else to waver ambivalently
between two different keys, unambiguously "proposing" neither the one nor
the other.  My Issue A, then, becomes this: (a)is the Subject "proposing"
_something_ about the organization of its tones?  (b)Something that makes
the tone D referential in any sense?  (c)And if so, what is the
"proposal," and what is the "sense"?   I draw readers' attentions to the
question marks in the immediately preceding text above, and to the posing
of three separate (serially posed) questions.

	[19] A note on Christoph Wolff's hearing: he tells me that a very
determinative thing for him, is that he hears the G-F# in the final figure
of the Subject completely unambiguously, as a FA-MI (and not a possible
UT-SI).  He then solmizes that figure to himself, wherever and whenever it
appears in the fugue -- which is all over the place -- as a motivic
movable-DO (or movable-UT) RE-SOL-FA-MI.

	[20] In the course of studying Nicolas's remarks I became  aware
of a interesting cultural split, in the ways he and I are thinking about
and listening to, the matters under discussion.  The split is not so much
between the idea of fixed-DO and moveable-DO.  After all, the U.S.
theoretical and pedagogical literature has many examples of both kinds of
systems, extending up through atonal and serial theory.<NOTE 9>   Rather,
I am thinking of the difference in conceptual background, between the way
a French (or Italian) speaker approaches solf'ege, and the way an English
(or German) speaker does.

	[21] I think the difference is best approched through an example.
I reach into my Marpurg bag again, and pull out this phrase: " ... der
hier vorhandene Fuehrer [zeigt] nicht die Tonart d dur, sondern vielmehr g
dur an ... ."  No solf'ege is involved in this discourse.  Nor is any
solf'ege involved in an English translation:   " ...  the Subject at hand
does not proclaim the key of D major, but rather much more G major."  But
the situation in French is quite something else: " ... le sujet en
question n'annonce pas la tonalite' de RE majeur, mais beaucoup plus celle
de SOL majeur."

	[22] In the French above, "d" and "g" have disappeared from the
German, and "RE" and SOL" have appeared in their places.  If we now want
to ask, "is the G an UT or a FA?" there is no linguistic awkwardness in
English (or German), but there is a very tricky sort of linguistic
"musical transposition" (so to speak) involved in the French, where we
have to work our conceptual way around the idea, "le SOL, est-ce qu'il est
un UT, ou un FA?"

	[23] No doubt this matter imposes certain differences in the ways
German/English speakers conceptualize issues of solmization, and the way
French/Italian speakers do.  The French and Italian conventions certainly
pertain to issues of fixed-DO in a heptachordal context, where "SOL"
translates German/English "G," but I think they involve more than that as
well.  I am not sure  exactly how or where the matter has impinged upon
the discussion between Nicolas and myself, but I sense it as a somewhat
covert (!) presence in that discussion, underlying in particular the
special significance, for Nicolas as for any French speaker, of the way in
which French heptachordal fixed-DO solmization developed historically.
Since I think of G as "G," rather than as "SOL," I can feel such a
significance only as an intellectual exercise, rather than as a perpetual
cognitive and aural-conceptual presence.

	[24]  Not particularly germane to all the above, but amusing by
way of coda, is a passage in Shakespeare which I have found useful to
bring hexachordal solmization to life for counterpoint students.  (I can't
think of any better occasion to put it on line or into print.)  The
passage is Edmund's second solilioquy in _King Lear_ ("This is the
excellent foppery of the world ... ," Act I, scene 2, lines 128-48).  At
the end of the soliloquy the bastard Edmund, plotting against his
"legitimate" brother Edgar, notices Edgar approaching.  He remarks, "My
cue is villainous melancholy ... ,"  and assumes an air of "serious
contemplation," (as Edgar subsequently describes it).  The soliloquy ends
with the text "Fa, sol, la, mi."  The idea, of course, is that the actor
is to sing an appropriate few notes "to himself."  I have attended quite a
few productions of the play.  In some the solf'ege was cut; in others the
actor recited the syllables without singing; in still others the actor did
sing, but sang (some transposition of) F-G-A-E, as if the solmization were
of the modern heptachordal sort.  I have never heard an actor sing what
Shakespeare obviously intended, that is, (some transposition of) F-G-A-B
natural.  Edmund is mutating from the top of the natural hexachord
(F-G-A-)into the MI of the hard hexachord (B natural), rather than into
the FA of the soft hexachord (B flat).  In doing so, he is deliberately
and self-consciously violating the rule "una nota super LA semper est
canendum FA."<NOTE 10>  Thus he is deliberately and self-consciously
presenting himself to the world at large as jestingly "diabolical," a pose
he assumes throughout the first act of the play.  Specifically, his "MI
contra FA" presents him as "the diabolus in musica."  I am not sure
whether Edgar hears Edmund's song or not.  In any case, Edgar seems to be
be a pretty unmusical fellow.  


				  NOTES 

<1>   My metaphorical "based," here, is deliberate and somewhat
tendentious.  I am suggesting that a _low_ D has an idiomatic role in this
connection.  The suggestion is consistent with traditional figured-bass
and  fundamental-bass theories, but it is also consistent with the idea of
the final note in the Subject, its lowest note, as projecting the UT of a
pertinent hexachord.  I am self-conciously avoiding the more usual
metaphor of "_in_ D", as e.g. "filling out the _interior_ of a Schenkerian
_Ursatz_ that prolongs a DM triad."

<2> I have always been surprised at that.  I would have expected Schenker
to be more sympathetic with Kirnberger/Schultz, and less so with Marpurg.
But I am thinking of Marpurg's _Handbuch bey dem Generalbasse und der
Composition_, when I have such thoughts.  Schenker, in his fugue article,
is clearly thinking of the _Abhandlung_ -- and / or the _Anhang_ on fugue
from the Composition book, and I suspect that he used Marpurg's work on
fugue as a text for his own early studies in fugue, and used it with
enjoyment.

translation of the treatise appeared 3 years after the first German
publication.  Marpurg's treatise on keyboard practice was originally
published in French, as _Principes de Clavecin_ (1756).  Marpurg lived in
Paris for some time during the 1740's (how much time is not clear), and
was known to have had friendly personal relations with (Voltaire and)
D'Alembert.  So we cannot suppose Marpurg ignorant of French theoretical
traditions, though his "translation" of D'Alembert's _Elemens_ does lead
one to question how well he might have understood them.  He was certainly
familiar with Rameau's study of fugue in the _Traite'_  (III, 44).
(Rameau does not employ solf'ege in that discussion.)

in consonant leaps -- though allowing various species of diatonic fillers
for most intervals.
	The idea of filling in a leap through various species of diatonic
series came up in paragraph [7] of this document, where I discussed
possible hexachordal solmizations of an octave leap up from a low UT.  If
one fills in the octave leap stepwise through a modern-major scale (or
imagines doing so), then the high note must be a FA; if one does not do so
(or imagine doing so), then other possible solmizations exist for the high
note.  If one specifically fills in the octave leap through a Mixolydian
scale (or imagines doing so), then the high note will be a SOL (because
the two notes below it, forming a semitone, must be MI and FA).  That
particular point will be taken up in paragraph [9] of this document,
immediately following the present note.

         In contrast, the systems proposed by George Perle and Milton
Babbitt are moveable-DO:  the number zero labels the first pitch class of
a motif or a series that is taken to be thematically privileged in some
way; the numbers one through 11 then label the other pitch-classes
according to the intervals they form with pitch-class "zero".

recorded explicitly before Praetorius (1614-15), but the rule was very
much in circulation during the middle of  the 16th Century, as Hughes
shows, and Shakespeare was clearly aware of it when he wrote _Lear_
(considerably later).

Lewin's most recent posting:

            [1]  I'm somewhat surprised that nobody has yet advanced a
Schenkerian rationale for hearing the fugue subject "in D," so I
shall try to supply some pertinent commentary here.

            [2]  Taking as a model Schenker's analysis of the cm fugue
subject from Book I, one might try to claim that the melody "proposes" the
key of D by outlining the following harmonic progression:

                 D        (C#   D)	
                 B         A    A
                 G         G    F#
                      E         D
          DM:   IV   ii    V    I
(As in Schenker's model, the parenthesized notes of the
progression, "implied" by the harmony, materialize in the appropriately
transposed-and-inverted counterpoint for the answer.)

            [3]  I think there is no doubt that "we" (in 20th-century
European-American culture) do hear the indicated harmony in the melody,
and that this has a good deal to do with our hearing the G-F# of the
Subject as a FA-MI (of some D structure), not an UT-SI (of some G
structure).

            [4]  The progression, however, does not determine in itself,
to what extent its final D harmony is an overall tonic for the phrase
as a whole, or an overall dominant.  In paragraph [2], I tendentiously
slanted the fundamental-bass (Roman numeral) analysis, to assert _a
priori_ that the D harmony was a tonic.  But there is nothing in the
progression-of-the-phrase itself, to indicate that the Roman numerals
might not equally well (or perhaps even better) be read as GM: I, vi=
DM:ii, V, I.  Or even as GM: I, vi, V/V, V. 

            [5]  The progression-in-itself thus seems to me to project D
as the weightiest Stufe of the phrase, but not necessarily as the overall
tonic.  Not, that is, unless one tries to add a rule to the effect that
the most-heavily-tonicized Stufe of a WTC fugue subject (or the
last-tonicized one) is de facto to be heard as a tonic.  But that rule
would be difficult to maintain in the face of other subjects, that clearly
end on heavily tonicized dominants (e.g. EbM Book I). 

            [6]  All this said, I think one gets a lot of value for
analysis of the (entire) fugue itself, from a Schenkerian approach to the
progression of paragraph [2] (or paragraph [4]) above.  The ambiguous
Roman-numeral analyses are not so much the point --  indeed one finds talk
already in Kirnberger and Marpurg, of inferring such harmonic structures
from fugue subjects.  The special value of Schenker's work here, for me,
lies rather in his inferring and discussing, from such a harmonic
progression, _thematic middleground voice-leading gestures_.

            [7]  I would like to comment a bit on Schenker's discussion of
the cm fugue subject from Book I, from that point of view.  Schenker
criticizes A.B. Marx for inferring, from the regular metrically accented
notes of the subject, a sort of "cantus firmus" linear gesture of Ab - G -
F - Eb.  Schenker does not consider that gesture relevant to a good
hearing of voice leading.  I recall, when I was first learning to play the
fugue,  how disappointing it sounded when -- hearing like Marx -- I heard
the opening Ab of Marx's cantus firmus "resolving" to the motivically
parallel G that comes next in his cantus firmus.  No _Spannung_ (tension)
remains, and one vaguely wonders,while playing: what need continue from
here?

            [8]  Schenker's analysis addresses exactly that point.  He
reads:
                            D                 (C)
             C              C       (C    B    C)
             G   Ab                  Ab   G    G
                     G(p!)     G(p)
                            F        F         Eb 

        cm:  i   iv! ------(ii?)-------   V    i

            [9]  The G in the third column of the figure above -- Marx's
cantus-firmus G -- is heard by Schenker as a _passing tone_ within a
dominant-preparation harmony.  Rather than resolve the preceding Ab, the G
passes on down to F, maintaining the _Spannung_ of the Zug Ab-G-F within
the iv (or ii) harmony.  Hearing the G _this_ way, no performer will feel
"why continue?"! The Zug is highly thematic for Schenker: it prepares the
rising figure F-G-Ab that follows in the foreground, and the immediate
response to that figure by the foreground cadential gesture G-F-Eb.

Stefano Mengozzi is perfecly right that I embrace a "strong" view of
hexachord when claiming that "singers and players of monodic intruments, in
the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance at least, must have conceived the
diatonic space as a complex contatenation of hexachords". My wording "must
have conceived" was meant to convey that this is a conviction rather than a
certitude, as in the French equivalent, "doivent avoir conc,u". I'd be very
sorry if this sounds "categorical" in English: that was not my intention.
On the other hand, I can but confirm my conviction.

Stefano Mengozzi is aware that several medieval and Renaissanc theorists
state that the finals of the modes are RE, MI, FA, and SOL (rather than D,
E, F, and G). It is true that they form only a minority, but the medieval
doctrine of the *affinitas* proves that other theorists similarly thought
that notes sharing the same hexachordal properties as D, E, F and G could
be used as alternative finals. I believe, therefore, that the "strong"
reading of hexachordal theory is amply supported by historical evidence. As
to Bach's mention of solmization syllables in WTC I, I fail to see how it
could mean anything else than that "exactly half of [his] preludes and
fugues in WTC, namely all those in a minor key, end on [...] RE".

I also believe that cases exist where mutations clearly are embodied in
medieval or Renaissance notation. More than once, accidentals are placed at
the point of mutation, instead of next to the note they concern. More
generally, an accidental flat or sharp, denoting a FA or a MI, often is a
token of mutation; and it could be argued that accidentals were notated
mainly in such cases where the mutation was not obvious. It is striking,
besides, that the "rule of the last flat or sharp" that I mentioned before
has almost exactly the same effect -- but for the essential fact that, in a
heptachordal context, it means a change of octave, thus of key, instead of
hexachord.

To view solmization as an 11th century theory grafted upon a repertory
where it had no place is in my opinion a gross misunderstanding of the role
of theory in general, and of solmization in particular. I won't even
discuss the first point (we all know, say, that the validity of Schenkerian
theory does not depend on the knowledge that tonal composers had of it). As
to the second point, it must be realized that hexachordal solmization is
but one formulation of a particular way of thinking that, at some point in
the history of music, may have been almost universal: tetrachordal
thinking. The history of Occidental theories of the diatonic system could
be written as the history of a tension between tetrachordal and
heptachordal thinking. Both are documented at an early stage in history, so
that it is not too difficult to find evidence for or against any of them.
But no historical account would be complete that would dismiss one in
favour of the other.

The tetrachord is the least group of intervals, the repetition of which
allows describing the diatonic scale as a whole; the price paid for this
economy is that the concatenation of tetrachords forming the scale must be
alternatively conjunct and disjunct. The hexachord is the maximum extension
that can be given to this basic unit without destroying the principle of
alternative conjunction and disjunction (which, in particular contexts, had
its advantages). The heptatonic conception simplifies the principle of
concatenation, but at the price of being based on a unit of seven notes
instead of four. That this is conception prevails today by no means renders
the other one "grotesque".

>From a tetrachordal point of view, the diatonic scale is a (complex)
concatenation of four tetrachordal "qualities". Guido discusses these
qualities at great length in the *Micrologus*, where he names them *modi
vocum*, "modes of the voices". It appears, then, that the modal
classification of a melody depends on the *modus*, the tetrachordal
quality, of its final (which, of course, determines the quality of the
other notes). And the reason why our Occidental theory knew four (groups
of) modes is that there are four qualities in a tetrachord. This conception
stresses characteristics of the diatonic system and of its degrees before
those of individual modes. Our modern conception on the contrary, because
it takes the chromatic scale as its background, tends to view the modes as
sub-sets of the background system (the degrees of which hardly could be
differentiated by individual intervallic characteristics) and the
intervallic qualities as characteristics of each of the modes. This is one
cause of our difficulty to understand modality. For a modern conception
that is closer to the ancient one, see Jacques Handschin, *Der
Toncharakter*.

Bach belongs to a transitional period of this history, so that it is
difficult to ascertain exactly what his position was. I like Murray
Dineen's idea that the reference to hexachordal solmization, that seems
unescapable in several of his composition, may have been a rhetorical
quotation of something considered archaic.

With regard to strong and weak views of hexachords and solmization:

1. The lack of collaborative theoretical contemporaries is a well 
meant caution, for which we thank Professor Mengozzi. But whether we 
must treat theorists' testimony as exhaustive--or lack thereof as 
proscriptive--is surely a moot point. Having met theorists and their 
preoccupations in our time, I know it quite possible that great parts 
of a musical work's being elude theoretical discussion, but are 
worked out theoretically in the field by composers and performers, 
often under the influence of long lapsed theoretical assumptions. 
   There are at least two kinds of history--one of which Collingwood 
disparages as armchair, the other he lauds as fieldwork, if I recall 
correctly.  The two are not incompatible--or need not be--but can be 
complimentary.

2. It seems not unthinkable that a practice of hexachordal 
solmization might have largely eluded theoretical notice as a 
commonplace, only to resurface here and there--Joel Lester's 
Albrechtsberger citation being a case in point.  Neither first (c. 
1825) nor second (c. 1837) edition  of Albrechtsberger's 
"...saemmtliche Schriften ueber Generalbass, Harmonie-Lehre, and 
Tonsetzkunst...." makes reference to solmization, as far as I can 
tell in a brief perusal. But that may, perhaps, be the product of 
both editions' editor, Ignaz von Seyfried, who might have sanitized 
solmization references, finding them too arcane for a developing 
readership of amateurs. If such it the case, then so much for the 
accuracy of the historical record.

Theorists of history could well apportion their grains of salt 
equally between testimony and projection--the two being the twin pans 
of the scales of historical justice.

 I would like to contribute further to this discussion by addressing two
questions asked by Joel Lester: "What COULD it mean for a musician to be
fully comfortable with mutating hexachordal solmization and NOT relate
that to diatonic space?" and "How could the hexachord NOT have been meant
to be an audible element of musical space, since the whole point of
solmizing was (is!) to make the intervals 'audible' conceptually?" I think
the answers to these questions depend on what we mean by the expression
"making the intervals audible conceptually."  I believe we have two
options, which I would preliminary call "weak" and "strong," which entail
two different ways of relating hexachord to diatonic space.  	
	One may view hexachords in the "weak" sense that Guidonian
syllables were attached to pitches regardless of where these pitches occur
in the diatonic space.  Take the two syllables RE-MI: they could designate
the interval D-E, regardless of whether it falls between 1 and 2 in the D
mode, 2 and 3 in the C mode, 4 and 5 in the A mode, and so forth.
According to this reading, the fact that the syllables RE and MI
correspond to the 2nd and 3rd positions within the hexachord was all but
irrelevant, because the location of the major second within the diatonic
space is determined by other factors, such as cadences, melodic contour,
or mode.  One may reasonably wonder, what is the point of using hexachords
if the position of pitches within them is irrelevant?  My answer is that
the first and foremost goal of solmization was to help untrained singers
execute intervals correctly, and that it was good enough for these
syllables to get a novice to sing correctly whatever interval after
identifying it on the page.
	Alternatively, one may argue that the function of hexachord was to
"make the intervals audible conceptually" in the "strong" sense that, by
assigning specific syllables to those intervals, it also superimposed a
grid of hexachordal scale degrees onto them, a theory which leads directly
to the conclusion that hexachords were also *audible* structures.  I would
like to question this interpretation  Nicolas Meeus understood me right
as the result of misconceptions that are unsupported by historical
evidence (as I have tried to argue in my review of Lionel Pike's
*Hexachords in Late-Renaissance Music* in the April issue of MTO).  For
example, I cannot find any secure indication in the theoretical literature
that mutations were *embodied* in the musical notation, as if waiting to
be recognized and "savored" by the performer, just as centuries later we
hear tonal modulations.  On the contrary, performers were customarily
instructed on how to *make* mutations in the most convenient way,
following certain rules of thumb, which is why there is nothing wrong with
different singers mutating at different points.  It seems to me that
mutations were perceived in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a
shortcoming of the system, rather than as a meaningful musical event.
Someone like Johannes Gallicus [1460's] spoke very clearly of "mutationum
deliramenta," and it seems to me that one can read subsequent
contributions to solmization theory, from Ramos to Heyden, from Waelrant
to Banchieri, as attempts to minimize, or bypass, the *problem* of
mutating between hexachords.
	Prof. Meeus embraces a "strong" view of hexachord when he claims
that "singers and players of monodic instruments... in the Middle Ages and
the early Renaissance at least, must have conceived the diatonic space as
a complex concatenation of hexachords (rather than a simple concatenation
of octaves)."  Again, I wonder what reasoning is behind that categorical
"must have conceived."  By the time Guidonian solmization comes onto the
stage, beginning from ca. 1100, there is a whole repertory of chant and
polyphony that was still performed daily (and will be so for centuries
afterwards, in some cases until today), as well as theories of intervals,
consonance and dissonance, counterpoint, and modes.  All of this came into
being without hexachords.  If we accept the thesis that "Guidonian"
singers of, say, 1200 began conceptualizing the diatonic space
hexachordally as a result of their daily solmizing practices, then the
conclusion is that they also started hearing mutations where there was
none  in other words, that they completely mis-heard the pre-Guidonian
repertory just as, today, we are supposedly missing a lot in
pre-18th-century music by failing to hear hexachords and mutations.  But
then, how can you hear something that does not exist?  Furthermore, if I
understand correctly Prof. Meeus's argument, then I have conclude that my
sense of musical hearing as a 20th-century Western listener makes me more
qualified to listen to early Indian music, based on the seven svaras, sa,
ri, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, than J.S.Bach's WTC.  (I see the problem of
adjusting to the Indian tuning system as much more manageable than that of
reconstructing my diatonic mindset in terms of overlapping 6-note
segments.)  Forgive me if I am missing something here, but I find this to
be simply grotesque.
	We know that J.S.Bach refers to solmization syllables in the
preface of WTC 1, as Prof. Meeus has already pointed out.  But shall we
conclude from this, following the "strong" reading of hexachord that I
have outlined above, that exactly half of Bach's preludes and fugues in
WTC  namely, all of those in a minor key  end on the second degree of some
6-note segment  namely, RE?  By which rationale is hexachord able to
define as tonic now its first degree (UT), and now its second (RE)?  If we
agree that a tritone is needed to define a tonic, how can a tritone-less
diatonic segment do just that?  Since when does a tonic fall on 2?  Are
hexachordally-aware Roman numeral analyses just around the corner?  Are
Guido 101 classes going to be part of the undergraduate ear-training
curriculum any time soon? 
	In the subject of the D major fugue, I agree that the opening
interval tends to suggest G as tonic, but I disagree with Prof. Meeus that
it is so because it would most likely be solmized SOL-UT in the G
hexachord, because the collection of pitches of the G hexachord
(G-A-B-C-D-E, accepting for a moment the problematic statement that
Guidonian hexachords consist of actual *pitches*) is also found in scales
other than G major, notably C major, A minor, if only in part, and
(descending) E minor.  Again, UT is not necessarily the tonic, nor the
only "seat" of a tonic, in Guidonian solmization.  So, it seems to me that
our perceiving G as a temporary tonic at the beginning of the Subject of
this fugue cannot depend exclusively on hexachordal considerations.
Rather, it is possible that the relationship should be reversed: because
the opening two notes of the Subject (due either to their rhythmic
placement, as Prof. Meeus has observed, or to our being used to hear a
descending fifth as implying a V-I progression, or both) suggest a passing
tonicization of G  i.e., the pitches D-C-B-A-G  it makes sense to solmize
that opening interval in the G hexachord, if for whatever reason we decide
to solmize that Subject hexachordally.

1. David Lewin is right that issues of solmization may be conceptualized
quite differently in French and in English/German. It is a problem of
which we have been aware in Paris, when working on solmization last year: we
decided to use the alphabetical names in our discussions, which otherwise
would have turned quite impossible. I have used the alphabet as a musical
shorthand since years, so that I trust I can conceptualize solmization
much as in English or German. There are other cultural splits, however.
 
2.1 One of them concerns "pitch class", an expression which has no
satisfactory translation in French ("classe de hauteur" is awkward). I
think, as a matter of fact, that there is something unsatisfactory in the
concept itself, because it tends to calling a "class" something that is
but a member of a class. As a class, pitch class C includes some eight or
nine members, e.g. from C0 to C8 in American pitch notation. When we
speak of "a C", or "in C", we actually think of none of these nine C's in
particular, but rather of an abstract C without register. It is this
abstraction that the expression "pitch class" rather improperly tries to
denote. I have proposed the French "hauteur nominale", "nominal pitch",
meaning the pitch insofar as it is designated by its name, without any
implication of register.

2.2 Because of this, I had not fully grasped David's point whether UT was
a pitch class for Bach. I do believe that that really is a matter of what
you understand by "pitch class". In one way, a pitch class (or a nominal
pitch) can exist only in a fixed solfege, because that is the only case where
the name always refers to the same pitch or class of pitches. In 18th-century
Germany, pitch classes in this first sense were denoted by the
alphabetical pitch names. Solmization syllables, on the other hand, in both
hexachordal and heptachordal solmization, were pitch classes (or nominal pitches) in
another sense. Hexachordal classes included various degrees in each
octave, in a rather complex and unstable way; and heptachordal nominal 
pitches applied to various degrees of the system, depending on the key. The
ambiguity also is in the word "pitch" itself (for which, again, there is
no simple French equivalent) which denotes either that characteristic which
we associate with frequency, or a degree in a scalar unit (a hexachord, the
diatonic system, and the like).

3.1 David indicates that his questions about the D major fugue were not
historical. I feel however that we cannot avoid historical
considerations, if only because our knowledge of solmization is second 
hand. If Bach's own
manner of solmizing in any way is of concern to us, then the history of
solmization must be taken in account.

3.2 The difficulties inherent in hexachordal solmization were strongly
felt in the 17th century and various devices (among which the SI) were
proposed to simplify it. One such device was to abandon the UT altogether 
(and the
LA, or the RE, to a lesser extent), with the practical result that one
returned to tetrachordal solmization. The rule of thumb was, for
instance,
that any note above SOL or LA (depending on whether the hexachords were a
4th or a 5th apart) was to be sung MI, and any note under MI was to be
sung SOL or LA. Let me quote Thomas Morley (1597; I quote the Playford edition
of 1730): "Now to sing your notes, you cannot use the words GAMUT, Are,
etc., they being too long; therefore their meaning is contracted to these
several short syllables, Sol, La, Mi, Fa; Ut and Re being left out, and
are with less Confusion supplied with Sol, and La. It was the Ancient
Practice [Morley, or Playford, probably means: to sing six syllables], and the
French generally use it now, but this Modern Way [i.e. of singing four
syllables only] is found less difficult to the young practicioner". J.
Wallis mentions this practice in his edition of Ptolemy in 1682. And
Burney (1789): "The ancients [i.e. the Greek] used likewise four different
monosyllables ending with different vowels, by way of solmization, for
the exercise of the voice in singing, like our mi, fa, sol, la". [This system
apparently sometimes has been called the "Lancashire system": does anyone
have information about that?]

3.3 I am not sure whether solmization was practiced with four syllables
in Germany, but even singing with six syllables, it could happen that a
major scale be solmized FA RE MI FA SOL RE MI FA, or FA SOL MI FA SOL LA MI FA,
with the same name for the lowest and the highest notes.

3.4 If I wrote that "a true hexachordal reading necessarily implies a
(missing) C NATURAL", it is because I believed that the structure of
Bach's subject necessarily implied a soft hexachord. I have been corrected on
this point by Stefano, but I still believe that this reading is the more
probable. It not only implies a C natural but, in hexachordal solmization,
it also results in that the name of the G is (or may be) the same as that
of the D, namely, FA or UT (depending on how you solmize). That is: G and
D must have been felt as belonging to the same hexachordal class -- i.e. as
sharing the same hexachordal function; in this way also, solmization may
have stressed the tonal ambiguity of the subject.

3.5 David's argument, on the contrary, is to the effect that D3 and D4 (d
and d' in English register notation) may have been perceived as belonging
to different hexachordal classes, or that they were different nominal
pitches. I am afraid this really is a question on which we cannot decide.
 
4.1 About the establishment of tonality, I would hate to have given the
impression that I despise Schoenberg. On the contrary, I am quite
interested in the idea of diatonic saturation because I believe that it
has a long and interesting history. My own view of tonality is different, but
it also stems from Schoenberg (namely from his classification of harmonic
progressions, another idea which also makes a fascinating history).

4.2 I agree that "weak" may not be the right term to describe the initial
statement of tonality. My point is that the key is first proposed in a
veiled way (is that better?). The first four measures of Prelude I in
WTCI expose a full "functional cycle", as Yizhak Sadai calls it, but sort of
veiled by the fact that the voice progressions are conjunct and that the
subdominant parallel and the dominant chords are not in root position.
(To pretend that these chords are but the result of voice leading would
neglect the fact that voice leading, in free writing, must conform to the rules
of harmonic progression.) Note, by the way, that the D major subject in
WTCII also implicitly proposes a "weak" functional cycle, tonic (D D D),
subdominant (G B [E]), dominant seventh (A G) and tonic (F#). The last
three notes, A G F#, certainly sound as 5 4 3 (or, as Christoph Wolff
hears them, SOL FA MI), not 2 1 7.

Re: Solmization and fugal tonality

Yesterday, Aug. 31, I posted a note with remarks about David Lewin's
MTO article on the WTC II, no. 5, which I interrupted. Herewith the
continuation of my remarks. Lee Rothfarb reminds me that this should
fall under the rubric of MTO-Talk, so I shall copy my letters to that
list.

In essence, my suggestion is that hexachordal solmization might be
looked upon not simply as a pedagogic or technical device by the time
of Bach, but that it might have assumed a rhetorical import, as a
conceit or "subject" proposed in the fugal subject to which the
remainder of the work relates as elucidation. In this sense, the
question that underpins Professor Lewin's discussion--C natural or C
sharp (fa or mi) ?--captures the rhetorical hexachordal import of the
subject. In my section 3, which I shall continue, I suggest that there
are many other facets, apart from hexachord, that inform Bach's
tonality, and some of these might well have been used in this
rhetorical manner.

3e. Tenor-superius cadence. There are two obvious tenor-superius
cadences later in the work, merely fortuitously in soprano and tenor
voices on the first two beats of m. 27 and over the bar line between
mm.32-33, and of course the ornamentation of the final cadence--the
suspension in the alto voice against the soprano, which is a residue
of the tenor-superius framework.  Just why Bach invokes this cadence
(as opposed to the fifth-falling-in-bass cadence, see m. 15 to m. 16)
at these points is again a matter of conjecture, but I wonder if they
are rhetorical flourishes designed to highlight various corners or
regions of Bach's tonal space. 
  Although the point is still moot, I believe the leading tone to
which the suspended superius resolves would have necessitated a
hexachordal "mi". In this (by now cliche) manner, Bach might have lent
special emphasis to certain tones, such as the E sharp and F sharp of
m. 27. Here I think I begin to approximate (and I recognize the
tenuous nature of the approximation) something like Schoenberg's
notion of an enriched and expanded musical space. The invocation of
the tenor-superius cadence invokes as well a hexachordal context--new
hexachords, in m. 27 one on C sharp and one on F sharp--that can be
used to enrich the tonality (if indeed such was Bach's plan, caveat
emptor). 
   As I have suggested (and as Lewin and Meeus have suggested too),
the fugal subject poses an ambiguity about musical space, by invoking
rhetorically the hexachord. The tenor-superius cadences that I have
pointed out, and their truncated counterparts (mm. 12-13 in bass and
alto) take up that initial rhetorical gesture--C natural fa or C sharp
mi?  In m.27 Bach's answer is C sharp, but C sharp ut (and E sharp
mi!). A scant six measures later Bach's answer would be C natural fa,
if one argues from the tenor superius cadence to G. Bach the
expressionist, again!

3f. Cross relations. Let me provisionally define "cross-relation" as
the juxtaposition of two pitches belonging obviously to two different
pitch collections. So for instance, F and F sharp must be cross
related in a diatonic context. Accordingly we might call mi-contra-fa,
B flat and B natural, cross related, or false related in a hexachordal
context.  I think of a cross relation as another type of ambiguity,
akin to the missing note above a hexachordal la.  
  It follows that Bach could have posed the question " C fa or C sharp
  
mi?" by cross relation in his subject, instead of by omission.  And I
find it interesting that he takes up a tonally close cross relation--G
natural and G sharp--in the continuation of his subject, mm. 2-3,
which seems merely to deepen the rhetorical question C or C sharp.
   Now the cross-relation of mm. 2-3 is so benign as to hardly merit
the label. But if we afford it rhetorical status, so that a composer
in Bach's day might have wondered what Bach was about to make of it,
the chromatically rich closing measures, starting circa m. 43 are rife
with similar cross relation (see bass and soprano in m. 46 in
particular). Rhetorically they form a kind of contracted catalogue of
the principal chromatics touched upon in the fugue: to the flat
side--D natural, F natural, G natural, and finally C natural; to the
sharp side--D sharp, F sharp, G sharp, and finally C sharp. I wonder
if a contemporary of Bach might not have admired this rhetorical
flourish, built(as much of it is) on the ascending tetrachordal motive
of mm. 2-3 (see the alto, last eighth of m. 45 to the downbeat of m.
46).  I am enough of a post-structuralist to recognize humour and
irony in this closing passage, but humour and irony are the offspring
of rhetorical excess: the cross relation of mm.2-3 is demure; those of
mm. 43ff uproariously humourous. 

3g. Falling-fifth-in bass. I have already noted the cadential import
of the falling fifth with regard to mm. 15-16, for example. In
combination with the resolution of the tritone, the two would single
mechanically (to follow Professor Lewin's citation of Browne, and of
Brown and Butler) the tonality. 
  But there is not a little rhetoric and humour I think in opening a
subject with a descending fifth, enough so as to lift Marpurg's crust
enladen eyes, as Christoph Wolff relates.  Presumably our contemporary
of Bach would have pondered the first notes: "D to G: sol to ut or ut
to fa, now what will Bach make of this?" The real fifth of the answer
would merely deepen the problem, especially with the G sharp in the
subject's continuation shortly thereafter. 
   If we return to Browne, and Butler and Brown, we have a problem in
the opening measures: where's the tonally defining tritone?  The
problem is created by omission (Lewin's C or C sharp?) and by cross
relation (my G or G sharp?) We need not be mechanistic about this,
however, since I think Bach planned this rhetorically in his subject,
and then appended a resolution in the last four measures (a resolution
that would have made his contemporary smile perhaps), again
rhetorically. 
   To drive home the tonality, a composer must place the tritone
correctly with respect to the framing fifth of the tonic and fifth
scale degrees. I think it is, again, a rhetorical gesture on Bach's
part to allude to the subject in the bass of m. 43 but to alter the
descending fifth to a tritone (especially amid all the cross relation:
the thing begins to sound uproariously funny--right out of Falstaff,
both Shakespeare and Verdi). Tritones abound here (so much so that my
Tovey edition can't quite decide the tenor part of m. 45), as if in
lieu of that missing tritone which the subject poses (C natural-Fsharp
or C sharp-G natural?), this coda seems to burst with them!
  I think the pentachord downward runs starting with the tenor in m.
47 elucidate both the tonality and the rhetoric, since the true
tritone G-C sharp is given an outlined prominence across the bar line
mm. 47-48, and the errant C natural is sequestered nicely by being
buried in both pentachord and tetrachord in the latter half of m. 48. 
The falling fifth cadence of m. 50 is redundant rhetorically, because
the tritone has already been fixed.

_______________________

In my spontaneous comments above I have merely tried to extend the
notion of rhetoric, which yesterday I tried to frame in light of the
hexachord.  It will be abundantly clear to some that I could have
phrased my comments in terms of a narrative, and read Bach like a
detective story (pace Cone): who done it, C or C sharp? Detective
stories are, of course, filled with rhetorical gestures (as indeed are
all genres, although not styles). Let me conclude with brief remarks
about that most rhetorical of theorists, Schoenberg.

Saturation is no doubt one way of expanding or filling a 
Schoenbergian tonality. But one aspect of the quarrel with Schenker,
which surfaces in Schoenberg's Harmonielehre, deals with imitation. In
the Roy Carter translation, on p. 385, Schoenberg notes that imitation
is a primary process in the development of harmonic resources. I take
him to mean by this that saturation is achieved by imitating diatonic
events through  non-diatonic tones. The crucial point--and here,
correctly or otherwise, he takes Schenker to task--is that imitation
need not be slavish. A secondary dominant need not resolve to a
secondary tonic to expand the tonality. I take this to mean that the
secondary dominant is a cliche--a rhetorical gesture--that achieves
its purpose by mere allusion. Functioning rhetorically we need only
here the secondary dominant to sense its potential resolution and
recognize the allusion to a secondary region.
  Accordingly, tonality is produced not by mechanics alone--the 
correct resolution of the correct tritone--but also by a 
consciousness that treats mechanics critically.
  I think that Bach the retrogressive inherited a wealth of devices
from the rich heritage of his ancestors, many of which he subjected to
a kind of bricolage. In this he has much in common with Schoenberg. 
As a result I put rhetoric and the notion of ambiguity at the heart of
my reading of the fugue. And, quite unlike Professor Lewin in his
conclusion, I think the "idea that the Subject is 'missing' some
C-or-C#" is anything but "tangential."

PS: With respect to Joel Lester's posting, the Mizler translation of
Fux (1742?)  and Mizler's Anfangs-Gruende des General-Basses (1739?) I
believe might elucidate the role of solmization in Bach's conception,
although it has been some years since I perused those volumes.

David Lewin's article on WTC II, no. 5, and Nicholas Meeus' comments
are the subject of the following comments:

1. Rhetoric and Bach. By Bach's time, and presumably long before, any
hexachord would have a certain ambiguity: should the next tone above
la be a soft fa or hard mi? I wonder if this question--certainly a
commonplace among composers and listeners of the day--took on a
rhetorical dimension (and by the term rhetoric, I mean the current
sense of a conscious conceit or literary technique, like irony). Like
the flat 6th scale degree in 19th century music, implicit hexachordal
usage (and there is no doubt in my mind that Bach's fugal subject
imply somisation by their structure) takes on formulaic dimensions,
measured against other, less formulaic structures, such as the system
of evolving chromaticism that temperament is beginning to allow.
  In other words, any good composer in Bach's milieu (and presumably
many a good listener) would have recognized the particular
manifestation of the generic mi-or-fa-above-la problem in this fugue:
"Ah, this is how Bach is framing the old question." The initial
descending fifth might have proved startling in this respect, but
there is much good expressionism in Bach, after all.

2. Fugal elucidation. If we allow the subject to be a rhetorical
device, we might profit by considering the remainder of the work as a
supplement--as an elucidation of the ambiguity, or a solution of the
problem posed by the subject. Our listening composer might, having
heard the subject and recognized the ambiguity, query inwardly: "Now I
wonder how Bach will elaborate and effect an elucidation, how he will
fill in this gap?"  Since there are at least two possible supplements
to the initial hexachord--mutation to a soft fa or to a hard mi--and
these might, in Bach's day, be carried out at various transposition
levels, this elucidation could take up the remainder of the fugue
(indeed could be carried out in parallel in other fugues, with
ambiguities or problems of a similar kind).
   I know little of the considerable rhetorical practices of Baroque
music, and the notion of rhetoric I invoke here, accordingly, draws
nothing from that conception. There are several threads in both
Lewin's and Meeus' thoughts that suggest an informal rhetoric, of the
kind I have mentioned, specifically Lewin para. 5 and 10, and Meeus'
Greimasian notion of isotopy (although I think there is too much human
calculation in rhetoric for it to work simply by recurrence).  My
suggestion is tie this rhetoric directly to the ambiguity of the
single hexachord: to invoke a hexachord is a gesture that invokes with
it a complex set of understandings (much like the initial move in a
game of chess).

3. Fugal tonality. Bach's tonality I think of as being particularly
complex and subtle--multifaceted with at least the following faces:

3a. A pitch-class gamut like that invoked by Lewin, but also a 
non-pitch class gamut, akin to medieval and Renaissance prototypes,
with sometimes tripartite solmization indications, like C sol-fa-ut.
The latter might bear some influence upon the questions raised by the
composer in Bach's day, so that we might envision this composer
querying: "Is this initial descending fifth D an ut-fa or an ut-sol?"
Again, the remainder of the work might be considered an elucidation of
this initial predicament.  
   We take our modern pitch-class gamut for granted in application to
modern music, but we need not do so for Bach's time, since the various
temperaments and tunings then gave a rather unequal division of
musical space. Here I refer not simply to the unequal temperaments
themselves but moreso to the notion that a wolf sounding low on a
keyboard or in some other scoring sounds quite different when compared
with its counterpart transposed into much higher registers.  There is
an intriguing article in an early issue of Early Music that traces
Bach's registral placement with regard to the wolves in a Werkmiester
temperament,  I believe.  With a quick perusal of my Tovey edition, I
find many supplementary sharps but not a flat. Does this mean that the
keyboard would have been tuned with more sharps in mind (presumably D)
than flats (presumably G)?  Would a good, contemporary ear, hearing
the rather low G# in m. 3,  have detected this inclination toward the
sharp side in the tuning, and added this to the list of clues in
Bach's elucidation of the hexachord problem? 

3b. Mode (but here I decline, leaving this to my betters, including my
colleague Lori Burns, cited by Lewin in his MTO talk reply to Meeus). 

3c. Hexachord (and possibly heptachord). Perhaps enough has been said
on this for the moment.

3d. Species of tetrachord (and pentachord). These interval species
are, perhaps, as rhetorical as the hexachord. They lie at the heart of
modal distinctions with regard to a final, but by Bach's time modal
distinction is sufficiently petrified to lend it the status of a
rhetorical device, perhaps. More important, I believe, is the use of
tetrachordal outlines to obtain variety in a work, and in particular
to obtain chromatic variety.  The rising fourth that spans beats one
and two of m. 1 is, to me, a rhetorical gesture: what hexachordal
syllables ought we to assign these notes?  The subsequent two notes
establish the tetrachord as a tone-semitone-tone type (E F# G A) with
only one possible location in hexachordal space, re-mi-fa-sol, in a
hexachord where ut is D. How ingenious of Bach to follow this
hexachord immediately with two others, one involving G# (suggesting
accordingly a hexachord on E) and then C# (suggesting a hexachord on
A).  In this way Bach, presumably, deepens the initial conceit (D or
G; or Lewin's C natural or C sharp?). This kind of tetrachordal
manipulation is produced by transposition, but it is an offshoot of
invertible counterpoint at intervals other than the octave (since at
these intervals tonal inversion often involves a change of tetrachord
type), which would be second hand to a master of invertible
counterpoint such as Bach.

Familial obligations require me to interrupt this letter, but I shall
try to conclude my comments in another posting.  I need to discuss
species of pentachord, the tenor-superius cadence, cross-relation, and
then falling fifth basses, and a note about Schoenberg.

Subject: Re: Solmization

1. David Lewin is right that issues of solmization may be conceptualized
quite differently in French and in English/German. It is a problem of which
we have been aware in Paris, when working on solmization last year: we
decided to use the alphabetical names in our discussions, which otherwise
would have turned quite impossible. I have used the alphabet as a musical
shorthand since years, so that I trust I can conceptualize solmization much
as in English or German. There are other cultural splits, however.

2.1 One of them concerns "pitch class", an expression which has no
satisfactory translation in French ("classe de hauteur" is awkward). I
think, as a matter of fact, that there is something unsatisfactory in the
concept itself, because it tends to calling a "class" something that is but
a member of a class. As a class, pitch class "C" includes some eight or
nine members, e.g. from C0 to C8 in American pitch notation. When we speak
of "a C", or "in C", we actually think of none of these nine C's in
particular, but rather of an abstract C without register. It is this
abstraction that the expression "pitch class" rather improperly tries to
denote. I have proposed the French "hauteur nominale", "nominal pitch",
meaning the pitch insofar as it is designated by its name, without any
implication of register.
2.2 Because of this, I had not fully grasped David's point whether UT was a
pitch class for Bach. I do believe that that really is a matter of what you
understand by "pitch class". In one way, a pitch class (or a nominal pitch)
can exist only in a fixed solfege, because that is the only case where the
name always refers to the same pitch or class of pitches. In 18th-century
Germany, pitch classes in this first sense were denoted by the alphabetical
pitch names. Solmization syllables, on the other hand, in both hexachordal
and heptachordal solmization, were pitch classes (or nominal pitches) in
another sense. Hexachordal classes included various degrees in each octave,
in a rather complex and unstable way; and heptachordal nominal pitches
applied to various degrees of the system, depending on the key. The
ambiguity also is in the word "pitch" itself (for which, again, there is no
simple French equivalent) which denotes either that characteristic which we
associate with frequency, or a degree in a scalar unit (a hexachord, the
diatonic system, and the like).

3.1 David indicates that his questions about the D major fugue were not
historical. I feel however that we cannot avoid historical considerations,
if only because our knowledge of solmization is second hand. If Bach's own
manner of solmizing in any way is of concern to us, then the history of
solmization must be taken in account.
3.2 The difficulties inherent in hexachordal solmization were strongly felt
in the 17th century and various devices (among which the SI) were proposed
to simplify it. One such device was to abandon the UT altogether (and the
LA, or the RE, to a lesser extent), with the practical result that one
returned to tetrachordal solmization. The rule of thumb was, for instance,
that any note above SOL or LA (depending on whether the hexachords were a
4th or a 5th apart) was to be sung MI, and any note under MI was to be sung
SOL or LA. Let me quote Thomas Morley (1597; I quote the Playford edition
of 1730): "Now to sing your notes, you cannot use the words GAMUT, Are,
etc., they being too long; therefore their meaning is contracted to these
several short syllables, Sol, La, Mi, Fa; Ut and Re being left out, and are
with less Confusion supplied with Sol, and La. It was the Ancient Practice
[Morley, or Playford, probably means: to sing six syllables], and the
French generally use it now, but this Modern Way [i.e. of singing four
syllables only] is found less difficult to the young practicioner". J.
Wallis mentions this practice in his edition of Ptolemy in 1682. And Burney
(1789): "The ancients [i.e. the Greek] used likewise four different
monosyllables ending with different vowels, by way of solmization, for the
exercise of the voice in singing, like our mi, fa, sol, la". [This system
apparently sometimes has been called the "Lancashire system": does anyone
have information about that?]
3.3 I am not sure whether solmization was practiced with four syllables in
Germany, but even singing with six syllables, it could happen that a major
scale be solmized FA RE MI FA SOL RE MI FA, or FA SOL MI FA SOL LA MI FA,
with the same name for the low and the high notes.
3.4 If I wrote that "a true hexachordal reading necessarily implies a
(missing) C NATURAL", it is because I believed that the structure of Bach's
subject necessarily implied a soft hexachord. I have been corrected on this
point by Stefano, but I still believe that this reading is the more
probable. It not only implies a C natural but, in hexachordal solmization,
it also results in that the name of the G is (or may be) the same as that
of the D, namely, FA or UT (depending on how you solmize). That is: G and D
must have been felt as belonging to the same hexachordal class -- i.e. as
sharing the same hexachordal function; in this way also, solmization may
have stressed the tonal ambiguity of the subject.
3.5 David's argument, on the contrary, is to the effect that D3 and D4 (d
and d' in English register notation) may have been perceived as belonging
to different hexachordal classes, or that they were different nominal
pitches. I am afraid this really is a question on which we cannot decide.

4.1 About the establishment of tonality, I would hate to have given the
impression that I despise Schoenberg. On the contrary, I am quite
interested in the idea of diatonic saturation because I believe that it has
a long and interesting history. My own view of tonality is different, but
it also stems from Schoenberg (namely from his classification of harmonic
progressions, another idea which also makes a fascinating history).
4.2 I agree that "weak" may not be the right term to describe the initial
statement of tonality. My point is that the key is first proposed in a
veiled way (is that better?). The first four measures of Prelude I in WTCI
expose a full "functional cycle", as Yizhak Sadai calls it, but sort of
veiled by the fact that the voice progressions are conjunct and that the
subdominant parallel and the dominant chords are not in root position. (To
pretend that these chords are but the result of voice leading would neglect
the fact that voice leading, in free writing, must conform to the rules of
harmonic progression.) Note, by the way, that the D major subject in WTCII
also implicitly proposes a "weak" functional cycle, tonic (D D D),
subdominant (G B [E]), dominant seventh (A G) and tonic (F#). The last
three notes, A G F#, certainly sound as 5 4 3 (or, as Christoph Wolff hears
them, SOL FA MI), not 2 1 7.

Stefano Mengozzi touches on a crucial point when he notes that
"There is of course little doubt that the six Guidonian syllables were
widely used from the Middle Ages onwards as a way to label or recognize
diatonic intervals and their various species;" and goes on to argue
"but from here to assert that, because Guidonian solmization was widely
used with this function, it also superimposed a grid of hexachordal scale
degrees onto the diatonic space, is a huge step that is supported by
little, if any, corroborating evidence."

I wonder. What COULD it mean for a musician to be fully comfortable with
mutating hexachordal solmization and NOT relate that to diatonic space?
Well into the "common-practice era," it seems, "tonal" musicians freely
used such solmization -- a practice documented well after Bach's death. 

I confess that I am still as astonished now as I was over a decade 
ago when I realized that Albrechtsberger, in his _Gru"ndliche 
Anweisung zur Composition" (Leipzig, 1790), published just two 
years before the 22-year-old Beethoven studied with him, gave the
following alternatives for solmizing the major and minor scales
on p. 1 of his text:

MAJOR:             or:  do  re  mi  fa
	do  re  mi  fa  sol la  mi  fa
	G   A   B   C   D   E   F#  G

MINOR:             or:  do  re  mi  fa
	re  mi  fa  sol la  re  mi  fa
	E   F#  G   A   B   C#  D#  E

Here, the tonic of major appears as "do" and "fa," and "do" 
denotes both tonic and dominant; and in minor "re" denotes
both tonic and the raised submediant. 

Albrechtsberger must have referred to pitches in this
hexachordal manner when he taught Beethoven species counterpoint 
(in major/minor keys, not in the modes!). Did the Beethoven whose
works formed the foundation for most tonal theories of the past
two centuries conceptualize the tonic equally as "do" and "fa"?

I join Mengozzi when he notes, "I am puzzled by the idea
of two different pitches having the same hexachordal function, again if
hexachord is taken to be a structural (read: audible) element of musical
space." But how could the hexachord NOT have been meant to be an "audible
element of musical space," since the whole point of solmizing was (is!) to
make the intervals "audible" conceptually? 

I do not know exactly when such hexachordal solmization finally faded from
pedagogy. But I do know that "late" instances such as Albrechtsberger's
do point to a pitch-spatial conceptual universe quite different from
ours -- yet one in which Beethoven was probably quite at home. 

(We can also be quite certain that Haydn conceptualized in such terms,
since he virtually certainly learned hexachordal solmization when he
was a choirboy at St. Stephan's at the end of the lifetime of Fux, 
6 decades before Albrechtsberger continued that tradition. Fux, after
all, had argued vociferously in defense of hexachordal solmization in the
mid 1710s in his dispute with Mattheson.)

Stefano Mengozzi makes the most interesting point that solmization may not
have been very practical when reading polyphonic music polyphonically --
i.e., when reading more than one part at a time -- because mutations occur
differently in the different part and if a note belongs to two parts at the
same time, it may have two hexachordal functions at the same time. More
specifically, it must have been quite uncomfortable for keyboardists. This
may explain why Schlick, for instance, stated that musica ficta was so
difficult for organists. I never realized that before, and I am quite
grateful.
The situation was different, of course, for singers or players of monodic
instruments when they read only one part. These, in the Middle Ages and the
early Renaissance at least, must have conceived the diatonic space as a
complex concatenation of hexachords (rather than a simple concatenation of
octaves). They must have thought in terms of what I proposed to call
"hexachordal classes" (see my communication at the European Congress of
Music Analysis in Trento), akin to our modern pitch classes. Is that what
Stefano doubts when he speaks of a "superimposed grid of hexachordal scale
degrees"? in that case, we probably should pursue the discussion.
A hexachordal perception (or a tetrachordal one, for that matter) is
characterized by the importance given to very local events; it is quite
incompatible with large scale perception. To hear Bach's subject as SOL SOL
SOL UT MI=LA SOL FA MI UT, with a mutation on MI=LA, is to perceive that
something changes at that very point -- that, in a way, the subject begins
"in G" and continues "in D" (and this, in addition, with respect to the
diatonic space itself, not the mode). Now, if such a conception included
nothing of the truth, David Lewin wouldn't have had to write his article.
Stefano is right that a reading of the subject in the durum/naturale
combination of hexachords is not utterly unthinkable. It seems to me quite
improbable, however, because it imposes a mutation "in the air", so to
speak, i.e. between notes rather than on one note that would assume two
functions in succession. It is true that the lydian fifth must be read FA
FA, and  that the two sharps in the signature at first may suggest such a
reading. My impression, however, is that the reader having said FA on the
initial D (because of the C sharp in the signature) would immediately be
quite puzzled about how to name the G. The situation would have been
different if the intermediate notes had been heard before, establishing a
lydian context and allowing a mutation on an implicit degree -- but these
previous notes would also have established a D major context, of course, so
that, once again, we wouldn't be discussing today.
I am not sure that this discussion can lead us to hear Bach's subject as
less ambiguous (why should we, it IS ambiguous); but it does help pointing
where the ambiguity arises, in the first two notes.

David Lewin's analysis of the Subject of Bach's D-major Fuge from WTC II
raises the important issue of hexachord as a diatonic structure that is
supposedly capable of shaping the way one hears music.  At [12], Lewin
wonders whether Bach could have heard (or sung) either the mutated, or one
of the unmutated versions of the subject, and at [16] he writes that "[he
is] (at present) happy to hear the Subject by itself 'in D,'
[understanding] the "D" at issue to be the UT of a pertinent hexachord,
rather than the tonic note of a common-practice tonality."  
	It seems to me that to hear a piece hexachordally can only mean
hearing musical pitch in terms of hexachordal (as opposed to heptachordal)
scale degrees or functions.  In principle, this is quite possible,
although I suspect that modern listeners will find it quite hard to hear a
major sixth as *the* main structural segment of the diatonic space, as
opposed to a mere portion of the octave.  I would be curious to know how
Lewin has trained himself to hear Bach's Subject in hexachordal terms and
how he has dealt with the problem of the cognitive discrimination between
the two "kinds of sixth."
	Of course, it is the mutated version of the Subject that raises
problems from a listener's perspective, if the assumption is that
mutations are there to be heard.  Let us assume, for example, that Bach
did hear the opening high D as the fifth scale degree (SOL) of a G
hexachord, and the closing low D as the first scale degree (UT) of a D
hexachord, and that he may even have felt a certain aural pleasure when
mutating between the two 6-note segments at some point along the way.  But
then, shall we also conclude that he heard both the suspended A in the
alto part of measure 5 and the following high D in the top part as the SOL
degrees of two simutaneous D and G hexachords?  I am puzzled by the idea
of two different pitches having the same hexachordal function, again if
hexachord is taken to be a structural (read: audible) element of musical
space.  The opposite, but equally puzzling, case, is that of the D on the
second beat of bar 8 in the left hand, which would seem to function as
both UT and FA at the same time.
	The question for us is not only, "was Bach accustomed to Guidonian
solmization," as Lewin asks, but also what was (or were) the precise
function(s) of Guidonian solmization for singers and composers across the
centuries?  This may sound like going back to Adam and Eve, yet
surprisingly little thought has been given to this issue.  There is of
course little doubt that the six Guidonian syllables were widely used from
the Middle Ages onwards as a way to label or recognize diatonic intervals
and their various species; but from here to assert that, because Guidonian
solmization was widely used with this function, it also superimposed a
grid of hexachordal scale degrees onto the diatonic space, is a huge step
that is supported by little, if any, corroborating evidence.
	Finally, I would like to comment on Nicolas Meeus's point that "a
'mutated' reading [of the Subject] necessarily must be based on the soft G
hexachord, because the second note of the subject (G) already lies outside
the hard A hexachord."  I am not sure that the choice of the G hexachord
is really a *necessity,* although I agree that it represents perhaps the
most obvious way to solmize the opening fifth.  Just as 17th-century
French singers used the "method du SI" in their "solfege mobile," so a
"Guidonian" singer, as a rule of thumb, would immediately translate any
sharp appearing  in key signature into MI.  Thus, it is at least
conceivable for an hypothetical singer to solmize Bach's Subject beginning
on FA of the A hexachord, and to sing again FA (of the D hexachord) on the
following G, as follows:

	FA FA FA / FA  LA  RE  SOL FA  MI  UT
	
It is admittedly a little bizarre to mutate after only one note, yet the
solmization FA/FA was customarily suggested, if I am not mistaken, as
appropriate for the "Lydian" (or third species of) fifth.  Besides, this
solmization requires only one mutation, like the others that have been
suggested.  In sum: I am skeptical about the idea that solmization may
provide a solution to the problem of pitch ambiguities, because pitch
ambiguities also increase the number of possible solmizations.  This is
precisely why the problem of so-called *musica ficta* in medieval and
Renaissance music is so frustrating: it is always possible to solmize
alternative versions of the same passage, regardless of whether or not you
decide to flatten your B's or to sharpen your F's.

I've postponed responding to this because somewhare I have a comparative

so far-->56 moves doth mess up one's references (what was B. Franklin's
exact saying ref the relationship of a household move to a fire?)

Does someone else--probably D. Lewin or N. Meeus--have such a comparative

simalar variances in tonal saturation?

Second & finally:  I studied w/ Wm Maht & even pub'd a rather naive article
in  JMTP on pragmatic solmization of sacred 16th c. It. works.  My work has
been far superseded by a number of subsequent scholars, including Lewin's
advisee, L. Burns',  work on the modal chorale settings of JSB (Pendragon
94??)

That, along with the new study by Jessie Owen which I haven't read, the
intensive research by theorist/musicologists such as John Kelleher,
illustrate the complex contextualities of solmization to multiple styles
and periods of composition. Timidly, I question the relationships of
solmization to JSB's knowledge  and usage of it, as implied by both DL and
NM?  My guess is that he depended to a considerable extent on his cousin,
J. Walthur's *Lexikon*, for which JSB acted as seller and agent?  The
Lexikon's section on modes fits well within  social-historical contexts but
represents only one of many concepts of modal definition and solmization?

This is my second posting commenting on David Lewin's article in MTO 4.4,
"The D Major Fugue Subject from WTC II: Spatial Saturation?
David states his "covert assumption that traditional Tonality is expressed
by exposing a complete diatonic gamut" and refers in this respect to
Schoenberg's affirmation in *Structural functions of harmony* that "a
tonality is expressed by the exclusive use of all its tones". David's
further argument is that if the subject of Bach's D major fugue does not
express all the tones of D major, it at least references the entire D
natural hexachord. The more general assumption behind all this, made
evident in the title of the article, is that tonality, in general, is a
matter of the saturation of a "tonal space" of some kind.
Let me first come back on the matter of solmization. David's mention of
Guidonian solmization refers us back to the medieval modes which, it must
be stressed, cannot be differenciated by their "tonal space": indeed, they
all make use of the same diatonic pitches and they all saturate the
diatonic gamut. It is quite interesting to consider in what the medieval
situation differs from that of "traditional (modern) Tonality". Two
conceptual changes occured, closely linked to each other: one is the growth
of the notion of pitch standard, which resulted in that modern tonality
also is a matter of pitch; the second is that the chromatic scale replaced
the diatonic gamut as the spatial background against which tonality must be
judged. (This point is clearly apparent in David's paragraphs 6 and 7, and
his paragraph 5 makes fascinating reading in this context.)
These changes did not happen at once and have been the cause of conflictual
situations. One of these is the opposition between hexachordal and
heptachordal solmizations mentioned in my last posting. There is, indeed,
something much more essential behind the apparently superficial difference
that one system had six syllables, the other seven. The syllable UT in
heptachordal solmization, as in Tonic Sol-Fa, denotes the tonic of a major
tonality, but it is impossible to assign it to any specific degree of the
chromatic system: "UT" (or any other solmization syllable) refers to a
particular tonal function and says nothing of the underlying system. The
situation is exactly the reverse in hexachordal solmization, where "UT"
merely denotes a given degree of the (diatonic) system, but cannot be
assigned a specific modal function. What differentiated the medieval modes
was whether they had RE, MI, FA, or SOL as final; what differentiates
tonalities the degree of the system on which their tonic falls. While the
syllables of heptachordal solmization express tonal functions (UT = tonic,
SOL = dominant, et.), those of hexachordal solmization denote what may be
called "systemic qualities", qualities inherent in each degree of the
diatonic system itself. "Quality" is the term used by Powers in his "Mode"
article in the New Grove (and elsewhere); Jacques Handschin said
*Toncharacter* in a similar meaning, and Guido of Arezzo spoke of the *modi
vocum*, the "manners of the notes". The differenciation between the modes
then becomes a matter of determining which systemic quality assumes which
modal function (e.g. the quality "RE" assumes the function of final).
In the context of medieval solmization, the saturation of a hexachord in
principle cannot express a particular tonality (or mode), it can only
manifest something inherent in diatonicism itself. Bach's subject, as a
hexachord, is thought in an entirely different context, if only because it
is transposed - a concept utterly foreign to medieval solmization. Besides,
I suspect that the use of hexachordal fugal subjects had other reasons as
well: more than once, what is expressed is a relation between tonic and
dominant, with a neighbor note to the dominant; also, should one not wonder
whether avoiding the 7th degree is not a "mixolydian" gesture, especially
considering that D major traditionally stands for the 7th mode?
David further writes: "The key of D major is specifically determined when
we hear the beginning of a real answer on the note A". Is that so sure? My
own view of tonality is that it is never decisively determined. Tonality is
a dynamic process; it builds up through the accumulation, the consistency
and the redundancy of markers which, in the case of Bach's fugue, include:
the D-(A)-F# arpegiation implicit in the subject; the syncopation on the
first beat of m. 2; the real answer; the G# in m. 3; the C# in m. 4; the
IV-II-V-I harmony underlying the subject in m. 5-6; ...; the cadence in m.
14-16; etc, etc. It is not before m. 50 that the piece definitely (and
definitively) is in D major. Tonality so described is an "isotopy", in the
sense of Greimas, a progressive desambiguation based on a hypothesis of
coherence. I believe that a tonality never can be established in a few
notes or a few measures. It is striking that tonal compositions often begin
with a weak statement of the tonality (the four first measures of the C
major prelude in WTC I being a most famous case), a statement that is later
confirmed, then put to test. I agree with David's conclusion that there is
something rhetoric in this; but I believe that the rhetoric play would
remain impossible if the initial tonal statement had been fully devoid of
ambiguity.

Subject: solmization

David Lewin's article on "The D Major Fugue Subject from WTC II: Spatial
Saturation?" in MTO 4.4 raises very interesting questions, some of which I
would like to adress in two postings. The first (the present one) will be
concerned with 18th-century solmization; a second, later one, will consider
the question of the initial tonality of the fugue.
     That Bach was accustomed to solmization in the context of the WTC is
made obvious by the title of Book I, "The Well-tempered Clavier, or
preludes and fugues in all tones and semitones, concerning tertiam majorem
or UT RE MI, as well as tertiam minorem or RE MI FA", etc. The question
arises, however, whether this refered to Guidonian (hexachordal)
solmization; or, to put it in other words: is the "unmutated" reading of
the subject that David proposes in his paragraph 9 compatible with
 Guidonian solmization?
    It happens that with some of my postgraduate students in Paris, I spent
last year researching the situation of solmization in 17th- and
18th-century France. We did not systematically work out the situation in
other European countries, so that our information concerning Germany
probably is incomplete and will read with interest any additional
information that David or Professor Wolff may provide in this respect.
    The French situation, for what concerns the problem that David raised,
can be summarized as follows. The SI, apparently introduced at the end of
16th century, came into general usage by 1650 as the seventh syllable of a
solmization system similar to the modern Tonic Sol-Fa. That is to say, the
tonic of any piece in major would have been sung UT, that of a piece in
minor would have been either RE or LA, depending whether the minor mode was
of the dorian or the eolian type. With this system, mutations were
unneeded. A very simple artifice allowed to easily choose the syllables to
be sung: the "last sharp" always was a SI, the "last flat" always a FA. The
"last sharp" and the "last flat" were not only the last ones in the
signature, but also any additional ones that would have appeared during the
course of the piece. (This is one of the causes, probably, why many French
students, even today, see a modulation whenever they see an accidental.) In
Bach's fugue under discussion, for instance, the C sharp in the signature
would have determined the first D to be read UT; the G sharp in m. 3 would
have been read SI (and the reader would have thought that the piece had
modulated to A major at this spot); the G natural in m. 4, being "flat"
with respect to the preceeding G sharp, would have been FA, the piece so
returning to D major; etc.
    This method, used mainly in singing, was known as the "methode du SI"
-- with reference to the "rule of the last sharp", according to which the
last sharp was a SI. Strikingly, it avoided the need to decide the key and
the mode of the piece. Consider a piece with one flat, B flat, in the
signature. The B flat, according to the rule of the "last flat", was to be
read FA, independently of whether the piece was major or minor. The tonic
was UT (on F) if the piece was in major, LA (on D) if it was in eolian
minor, or RE (on G) if it was in dorian minor. Treatises of the time note
that the case is more difficult when there is no signature at all, for it
is then necessary to consider the cleffing of the piece and to call SOL, UT
or FA the note indicated by the G, the C or the F clef, respectively.
    The heptachordal solmization, later dubbed "solfege mobile", was bound
to evolve into a "solfege fixe", in which the syllables became the names of
fixed pitch classes, as in the alphabetic systems, producing the well known
correspondence between the French and English note names, LA = A, SI = B,
DO (or UT) = C, etc. This evolution apparently took place in France early
in the 18th century, so that the usage of the heptachordal solmization
lasted no longer than about sixty years, roughly from 1650 to 1710,
although some may have kept it later.
    David's paragraph [14] seems slightly confused in this context, when he
asks "Was UT a pitch class for Bach, in the way that DO is for us in modern
solfege?" If I am not mistaken, in the modern (American) solfege to which
David refers, and which I take to be similar to the Tonic Sol-Fa system, DO
cannot be a "pitch class"; in is only in the French "solfege fixe" that it
is so. Three possibilities must be considered:
1) Bach may have considered UT as a hexachordal syllable which, in a major
key, would have denoted either the 1st or the 5th degree (in D major,
either D or A); in this case, his solmization would have involved
mutations.
2) Bach may have considered UT as a HEPTACHORDAL solmization syllable
which, as in modern American solfege or in the French late-17th-century
"methode du SI", would have denoted the tonic of a major key (D in D
major), the mediant (or possibly the subtonic) of a minor key; his
solmization would have been "non mutating".
3) Bach might have considered UT as a pitch class, namely pitch class C,
had he known the modern French usage of the time he composed WTC II.
Without any reference to the French usage, however, he certainly thought in
this way in the context of the German alphabetic terminology, which denoted
pitch classes.
    Heptachordal solmization had been advocated in Germany as early as the
very first years of the 17th century, by Burmeister (1601), Calvisius
(1611) and others. (Outside Germany, similar systems were described by
Puteanus, probably a Fleming, publishing in Italy from 1599 onwards, by
Banchieri in 1614, by Zacconi, Mersenne, etc.) Hitzler, in Germany,
proposed in 1623 the "bebisation", a modified alphabet that allowed naming
all twelve pitch classes. The system was based on the ancient (oddonian)
alphabet; an "e" or an "i" being appended to each of the consones to denote
its flatter or sharper version ("be" meant B flat, "bi" B natural, "ce" C
natural, "ci" C sharp, etc.). As this was not practicable for the vowels, A
was replaced by "la", E by "mi"; E flat became "me", while "la" knew only
one form, A natural. Bebisation obviously is at the origin of the German
expressions Bes, Cis, etc. A similar system (with other note names) was
advocated by Gibelius in 1659, and several others (some of which quite
funny) are documented, also in France.
    Mattheson (*Das neu eroeffnete Orchestre*, 1713), states that the
degrees of the diatonic scale can be denoted either by the seven first
letters of the alphabet or by the seven syllables DO RE MI FA SOL LA SI. He
knows modifications of the alphabet for the chromatic degrees but,
following the usage of organ makers, he uses them rather undiscriminately,
describing for instance the C minor triad as "C Dis G" instead of "C Es G",
the B major one as "H Es Fis" instead of "H Dis Fis", etc. Buttstett (*Ut
mi sol re fa la, tota musica et harmonia aeterna*, 1716) criticizes
Mattheson and advocates hexachordal solmization. Mattheson's answer, in the
defense of heptachordal solmization, is in *Das beschuetze Orchestre*
(1717), with complements (including a letter by Fux in favor of the
hexachordal solmization) in *Critica musica* (1722 and 1725). Solmization
was not the main topic of the quarrel, however, which also involved the
number of the modes and the extent to which they could be transposed.
Bach's WTC, with only two modes and twelve transpositions, obviously is on
the side of Mattheson.
    Bach, therefore, probably was accustomed to all three systems, which
were at the heart of a raging discussion in his circle: the hexachordal
(Guidonian) solmization, the heptachordal solmization (solfege mobile,
modern Sol-Fa), and the fixed pitch-class names (solfege fixe) in the form
of the alphabetical notation. (And Marpurg also probably knew these
systems, so that his comments on the tonality of Bach's subject indicate
that solmization may not have been sufficient to resolve the ambiguity.)
    David suggests the possibility of an "unmutated" hexachordal reading of
Bach's subject, UT UT UT FA - LA -- RE SOL FA MI - (UT). But the very
concept of a non mutating hexachordal solmization seems troublesome, as it
could only cope with cases like this one, where the melody fails to provide
the 7th degree, making it unneeded to decide between a subtonic and a
leading note. If the subject had included either a C or a C#, then a
mutation would have been necessary. (This is to say: the unmutated reading
is possible only because the subject indeed in tonally ambiguous.) The
unmutated reading must be viewed as belonging to heptachordal solmization.
But then a second reading becomes possible, namely SOL SOL SOL UT - MI --
LA RE UT SI - (SOL), so that it remains impossible to determine whether the
subject is in D or in G.
    David also proposes "mutated" readings of the type SOL SOL SOL UT/FA -
LA -- RE SOL FA MI - (UT) (the exact position of the mutation is not
relevant) which, he adds, "reference the entire natural D hexachord [but
not] the entire soft G hexachord". What strikes me here is that, indeed, a
"mutated" reading necessarily must be based on the soft G hexachord,
because the second note of the subject (G) already lies outside the hard A
hexachord. In other words, a true hexachordal reading necessarily implies a
(missing) C NATURAL instead of a C sharp. Solmization, in other words, may
be invoqued to justify that the subject is in G major instead of D major (I
will comment on the argument of "saturation" in my second posting). Another
conclusion is that the tonal ambiguity of the subject results not only from
the absence of the C/C#, but also from the initial jump of a fifth
downwards.
