</H1>
<P>
<B>(for expert programmers only)</B>
<P>
At present time, the executables of DirectCsound are compiled using Microsoft
Visual C++ Developer Studio version 5.0. The projects, workspaces and makefiles
provided with the sources are generated with this compiler. A Developer
Studio&nbsp;workspace can contain several projects (it is the case of
DirectCsound workspace).
<P>
DirectCsound Workspace is provided with three main projects:
<OL>
  <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="#9f9f9f"><B>CsoundVST</B> (an attempt to turn Csound into a
    VST Plugin. This is a very alpha version, and I don't recommend to attempt
    to use it, because it is very unreliable and instable)</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="#000080"><B>DirectCsoundCon</B></FONT> is the console-based
    version of DirectCsound
  <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="#000080"><B>DirectCsoundWin</B></FONT> is the GUI version of
    DirectCsound
</OL>
<P>
Both <B><I>DirectCsoundCon</I></B> and <B><I>DirectCsoundWin</I></B> projects
are provided with four <I>Configurations</I>:
<OL>
  <LI>
    <B><I>Win32 Debug</I></B>
  <LI>
    <B><I>Win32 Release</I></B>
  <LI>
    <B><I>Win32 double Debug </I></B>(64-bit floating point version)
  <LI>
    <B><I>Win32 double Release </I></B>(64-bit floating point version)
</OL>
<P>
To build one or more targets of DirectCsound you can
<UL>
  <LI>
    use the provided makefiles (<B><I>"DirectCsoundCon.mak"</I></B> &nbsp;and
    <B><I>"DirectCsoundWin.mak"</I></B>) with <B><I>nmake</I></B> or
  <LI>
    open the workspace named <B><I>"DirectCsoundWin.dsw"</I></B> with Microsoft
    Visual C++ Developer Studio version 5.0
</UL>
<P>
If you are using Developer Studio, be sure to activate the correct project
and Configuration first.
<P>
Even if later version of Visual C++ should be compatible with earlier ones,
actually, this is not always true, since I noticed that many users run into
difficulties when attempting to compile DirectCsound with a version of MSVC
different from the 5.0. In this case you should reconstruct the Project by
scratch, and &nbsp;I give the following suggestions:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Include all source files contained in the project of old MSVC version.
  <LI>
    Set all global macro #defines (for each project you intend to build)
  <LI>
    Set the runtime library type to Multithreaded
  <LI>
    Provide special libraries and include files (for DirectSound, EAX and Paintlib)
  <LI>
    Set alternative include directory paths and library paths (if you put the
    special libraries in a custom directory)
  <LI>
    Set particular compilation directives (different from project defaults) for
    some special files
</OL>
<H3>
  1. Including source files
</H3>
<P>
You can see the files to include by opening a project file (with extension
.dsp) with a text editor and by observing included files having C, CPP, and
CXX extension. For example:
<P>
<TT># Begin Source File<BR>
SOURCE=.\DirectXcapture.c<BR>
# End Source File</TT>
<P>
<TT># Begin Source File<BR>
SOURCE=.\DirectXout.c<BR>
# End Source File</TT>
<P>
<TT># Begin Source File<BR>
SOURCE=.\DirectXset.c<BR>
# ADD CPP /D "INITGUID"<BR>
# End Source File</TT>
<P>
<TT>...... etcetera ......</TT>
<P>
You have to include all source files: this can be done by using the IDE interface
by left-clicking the project name (in the following case "DirectCsoundWin
files") and by choosing "Add Files to Project".
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict7.jpg" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="335" HEIGHT="385">
<P>
A browse-file dialog-box will appear and you can select the files you intend
to add to the project.
<IMG SRC="pict8.jpg" ALIGN="Bottom" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="296">
<P>
I don't know if later versions of MSVC allow the same procedure.
<P>
<H3>
  2. Setting global #defines macros
</H3>
<P>
Next pass is to provide the correct settings for the project. You can do
this by selecting the "Project-settings" options. A dialog box will appear,
and you have to select the "C/C++" tab.
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict9.jpg" ALIGN="Bottom" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="577" HEIGHT="369">
<P>
In the "Preprocessor definitions" text field you have to put the following
macro definitions:
<P>
For <FONT COLOR="#804040"><B><I>DirectCsoundCon</I></B></FONT> project:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Win32 Debug Configuration:
  <DD>
    WIN32, _DEBUG, _CONSOLE, _MBCS, _WINDOWS, SFIRCAM, PIPES, MACROS, RTAUDIO,
    MSVC, GAB_RT, STRICT, GAB_EAX

    GAB_EAX, GAB_WIN, RESET, MYFLT=double
</DL>
<H3>
  3. Setting Runtime Library Type
</H3>
<P>
You have to set the runtime library to <B>"Debug Multithreaded"</B> for "Win32
Debug" and "Win32 double Debug" configurations and <B>"Multithreaded"</B>
for "Win32 Release" and "Win32 double Release" configurations:
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict10.jpg" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="577" HEIGHT="188">
<P>
<H3>
  4. Providing special libraries
</H3>
<P>
Special libraries are needed to make a full compilation of DirectCsound.
These libraries (together with their include files) should be put in MSVC
include directory and lib directory or in a custom user path. In the last
case you have to provide this path to each project.
<P>
The required libraries are:
<P>
Microsoft DirectSound libraries:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>dsound.h</B> and <B>dsound.lib</B> got from Microsoft DirectX 7.0 SDK
    (or later version)
</DL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"><B><I>EAX 2.0</I></B></FONT>: &nbsp;
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>eax.h, &nbsp; eax.lib </B>and <B>eaxguid.lib</B>
  <DT>
    You can get the EAX 2.0 SDK at the following URL:
  <DD>
    <A HREF="http://developer.soundblaster.com/dev-resources/">http://developer.soundblaster.com/dev-resources/</A>
  <DD>
    note: you can avoid to provide this library if you don't have a soundblaster
    Live or you don't intend to use EAX 3D sound extensions in DirectCsound.
    To do that, simply delete the GAB_EAX macro define in the corresponding project
</DL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"><B><I>Paintlib</I></B></FONT>:
<DL>
  <DT>
    all include files of paintlib plus <B>paintlib.lib, libtiff.lib, libjpeg.lib,
    libpng.lib</B><BR>
    You can get paintlib sources at the following URL:
  <DD>
    <A HREF="http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/">http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/</A>
</DL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"><B><I>FLTK</I></B></FONT>:
<DL>
  <DT>
    all include files of FLTK (Fast Light Tool Kit) plus <B>fltk.lib </B>(for
    release version) or <B>fltkd.lib </B>(for debug version). You can download
    FLTK at the following URL:
    <A HREF="http://www.fltk.org/">http://www.fltk.org/</A>
  <DD>
</DL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"><B><I>OpenGL</I></B></FONT>:
<DL>
  <DT>
    all include files of OpenGL, GLUT and GLU plus <B>opengl32.lib</B> and
    <B>glut32.lib</B>. You have to download the GLUT library. There are several
    internet sites that provide it. Make a web search to find it.
</DL>
<P>
Once you placed the include and lib files in a directory, you have to add
the library to the link directory options. To do that, you have to select
"Project-Settings" and the "Link" tab of the Settings dialog box, then filling
the "Object/library modules" text field with the required libraries:
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict11.jpg" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="577" HEIGHT="219">
<P>
...that are
<P>
<B>dsound.lib eaxguid.lib winmm.lib wsock32.lib paintlib.lib libtiff.lib
libjpeg.lib libpng.lib kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib
comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib fltk.lib
opengl32.lib</B>
<H3>
  5. Setting additional directory paths for include files and libraries
</H3>
<P>
If you placed the special library in a path different from
<B>..\DevStudio\VC\lib</B> and corresponding include files in a path different
from <B>..\DevStudio\VC\include</B>, you have to provide the custom directories
where you placed these libraries, by setting corresponding path in the
Project-Setting dialog box:
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict12.jpg" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="577" HEIGHT="292">
<P>
... and ...
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict13.jpg" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="577" HEIGHT="252">
<P>
<H3>
  6. Setting particular compilation directives (different from project defaults)
  for some special files
</H3>
<P>
Some source files have project settings slightly different from project defaults.
These are:
<P>
<B>sfont.c</B>
<DL>
  <DT>
    with this file you have to set "Struct member alignment" to "1 Byte":
</DL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict14.jpg" ALIGN="Bottom" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="577" HEIGHT="369">
<P>
<B>rtaudio2.c</B>, <B>aops.c </B>and <B>lptrkfns.c</B>
<DL>
  <DT>
    probably due to a bug of MSVC 5.0 with these files you have to remove all
    speed optimizations except:
  <DD>
    Generate Intrinsic Fuctions<BR>
    Favor Fast Code<BR>
    Frame Pointer Omission
</DL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict15.jpg" ALIGN="Bottom" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="577" HEIGHT="369">
<P>
... otherwise some problems will rise during compilation or run-time.
<P>
<B>DirectXset.c</B>
<P>
you have to add the INIGUID define macro
<P>
