Make an F-Statement that will create an exponential curve going from 1.0to .001f1 0 16385 5 1.0 16384 .0012. What are two different Csound units that you might use with the abovefunction to create an envelope? Show each complete with appropriatearguments.a)  kenv	oscil1	0, 10000, 3, 1this envelope's amplitude will go from 10000 to 100, exponentially, in 3 secs.b)  kenv 	oscil1i	0, 10000, 3, 1this one interpolates between the 16384 points on the curve, creating a smoother shape.3. Show a Csound unit generator that can create the same envelope withoutthe use of an F-Card.kenv	expseg	1.0, 3, .0014. In FM, what effect does the amplitude of the Modulating Oscillator haveupon the signal.  The amplitude of the modulating oscillator controls the amount of deviation the signal will have from the carrier frequency.  The deviation represents the index of modulation (the number of pairs of sidebands) multiplied by the frequency of the modulating oscillator.5. In FM, show the partials that would be present with Fc=200, Fm=100, and 5pairs of sidebands.	The partials would be 100, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 hz.  Due to wraparound, the partials at 100, 300 hz and the carrier freq (200) will be stronger.6. In the above, what will be the fundamental pitch?100 hz7. How would you create inharmonic partials (not integer muliples of thefundamental) using Frequency Modulation?	Inharmonic partials are created when the modulating frequency is not a whole number multiple of the carrier frequency.  You would have a modulating frequency which could not evenly be divided by that of the carrier.8. Briefly, what is a formant?	A formant gives character to an instrument.  It is a strong frequency within the sound of an instrument.  In a voice saying 'ee', for example, there is always energy at or around 2200 hz (approximately).  That is not to say that all formants are 'fixed', as our examples in the book are; they sometimes move in relation to the fundamental. 9. Show how to derive a formant frequency that is near 2290Hz but still aharmonic of 440Hz.int((2290/440)+.5) * 440	is this enough?		int returns the whole number (left of the decimal point) result of (2200/440)+.5.  The .5 insures that a number closer to the 'whole number +1' will be rounded correctly.10. In Common Music code you have seen, what is the purpose of thefollowing:         (setf *totaldur* (max (+ time dur) *totaldur*))	I wasn't here for the explanation of 'max' and can't find it in the cm dictionary.		This sets the value of *totaldur* to the sum of time and dur, possibly setting a limit to it by the previously assigned value of *totaldur*. (?)11. Write the Lisp code that will set the value of pitch to 1000 and dur to50 if the variable count is less than 75 (remember, it should do set bothpitch and dur) and will otherwise only set the value of pitch to be arandomly chosen number between 300 and 500.(if (< count 75)	(progn		(setf pitch 1000)		(setf dur 50))	(setf pitch (between 300 500))	)
