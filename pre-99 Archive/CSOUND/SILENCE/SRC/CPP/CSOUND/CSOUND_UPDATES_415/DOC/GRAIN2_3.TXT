INITIALIZATION
==============

iovrlp - (fixed) number of overlapping grains in grain2.

imaxovr - maximum number of overlapping grains in grain3. The number of
  overlaps can be calculated by (kdens * kgdur); however, it can be
  overestimated at no cost in rendering time, and a single overlap uses
  (depending on system) 16 to 32 bytes of memory.

iwfn - function table containing window waveform (GEN20).

irpow - this value controls the distribution of grain frequency variation.
  If irpow is positive, the random distribution (x is in the range -1 to 1) is
  abs(x) ^ ((1 / irpow) - 1); for negative irpow values, it is
  (1 - abs(x)) ^ ((-1 / irpow) - 1). Setting irpow to -1, 0, or 1 will result
  in uniform distribution (this is also faster to calculate). The image
  "grain2_rand.png" shows some examples for irpow.
  The default value of irpow is 0.

iseed - seed value for random number generator (positive integer in the range
  1 to 2147483646 (2^31 - 2)). Zero or negative value seeds from current time
  (this is also the default).

imode - sum of the following values:

  64: (grain3 only) synchronize start phase of grains to kcps.
  32: (grain3 only) start all grains at integer sample location. This may be
      faster in some cases, however it also makes the timing of grain envelopes
      less accurate.
  16: (grain3 only) do not render grains with start time less than zero (see
      the image "grain3_1.png"; this option turns off grains marked with red
      on the image).
   8: interpolate window waveform (slower).
   4: do not interpolate grain waveform (fast, but lower quality).
   2: grain frequency is continuously modified by kcps and kfmd (by default,
      each grain keeps the frequency it was launched with). This may be
      slower at high control rates. In grain3 it also controls phase
      modulation (kphs).
   1: skip initialization.
  The default value is 0.

PERFORMANCE
===========

ar - output signal.

kcps - grain frequency in Hz.

kphs - (grain3 only) grain phase.

kfmd - random variation (bipolar) in grain frequency in Hz.

kpmd - (grain3 only) random variation (bipolar) in start phase.

kgdur - grain duration in seconds.

kdens - (grain3 only) number of grains per second. In grain2, this is fixed to
  (iovrlp / kgdur).

kfrpow - (grain3 only) distribution of random frequency variation (see irpow).

kprpow - (grain3 only) distribution of random phase variation (see irpow).
  Setting kphs and kpmd to 0.5, and kprpow to 0 will emulate grain2.

kfn - function table containing grain waveform. Table number can be changed at
  k-rate (this is useful to select from a set of band-limited tables generated
  by GEN30, to avoid aliasing).
