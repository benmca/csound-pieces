This is the main README for Common Music.  Documentation, examples, the CM
home page (cm.html) and the installation guide (install.html) are all
located in the doc/ directory.  Documentation is in HTML format so
you also need a Web browser.  You can get Netscape or Mosaic free of charge
from the Internet:

  NCSA Mosaic (Macintosh, X Windows, Windows)
    www: http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu
    ftp: ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu

  Netscape (Macintosh, X Windows, Windows)
    www: http://www.netscape.com
    ftp: ftp.netscape.com

To learn about the system start with doc/cm.html and follow the documentation
links.

If you are on an Unix or WIndows machine, probably the easiest way to work with Common Music is to run it as an Emacs (or XEmacs) subprocess. See cm/site/_emacs for an example Emacs init file.  You can download Emacs from the following sites:

Xemacs (Unix/X Windows):
  http://www.xemacs.org/

Gnu Emacs for Windows/NT:
  http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html
