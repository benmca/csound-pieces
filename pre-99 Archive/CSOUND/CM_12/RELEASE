The binary release of Common Music contains a runtime image plus all
system documentation and example files. Each binary release is a bit
different depending on the current state of CM in that OS/Lisp
combination (and any vendor licensing conditions). At a minumum,
all ports contain the basic kernel and can generate MIDI and CSound
score files. The differences are summarized in this table:

        Lisp     Compiler?  Csound?  CLM?      MIDIFile? MIDIRealtime?
        -------------------------------------------------------------
MacOS:  MCL 4.2  no         yes      no        yes       yes(OMS)
Win32:  CLISP    byte       yes      no        yes       no
Linux:  CLISP    byte       yes      yes(OSS)  yes(OSS)  no
IRIX :  CLISP    byte       yes      no        yes       yes

To use some other combination of features, or to include syntaxes
other than the ones listed here, or to have the compiler available in
MCL, you will need to ftp the sources and build the system yourself.


Macintosh Notes:

  MIDI real time support requires that the Opcode Midi System be installed.
  You can download OMS from http://www.opcode.com/downloads/oms/mac/


Linux Notes:
 
  CLM Audio support requires that the OSS sound drivers be installed.
  You can download the OSS drivers from http://www.4front-tech.com
  The oss download also contains mplay, a shell command that can play
  midi files from CM (See *midifile-player* entry in the dictionary.)

  Edit the cm script file and change the pathnames for cm.mem and
  lisp.run to relect your machine. Thereafter you can start Common Music
  from a shell or Emacs by invoking the script.


Windows Notes:

  A shell-based MIDI file player for NT/Win95 would be a Good Thing...

  Edit the CM.BAT script file and change the pathnames for cm.mem and
  lisp.run to relect your machine. Thereafter you can start Common Music
  from a shell or Emacs by invoking the script.
