I brought the question to stimulate discussion, and am 'on the fence' with it.  I agree with your point about his appreciation of documentary, and his improvisatory flair that occasionally comes to the fore.  I think, when you boil it all down, he was a GOOD composer.  That is, always taking chances, goin with instincts, etc, in order to make his idea as sincere.. maybe that's the wrong word.. as lucid as possible. (?)
I think he is successful at times (70%?) and at time not.  
And example of successful would be the sequence you mention below from Solaris.  I'm beginning to explore electro-acoustic music as a composer, and find his use of sound here to be very simple and musical.  I would argue that role Gestalt 
theory plays here, and would encourage everyone to listen to the sounds leading up to this point:
From the get go, nature sounds are at the fore, and stick to their respective scenes; that is, those in which they were actually recorded.  Slowly there builds a smearing of the time element: We hear the water in the fore even as Chris goes inside (also a little foreshadowing? maybe too subtle.. ) the house.  This process is explored, not entirely smoothly, up until what I think of as the crescendo, when (I forget his name) returns to the city.

I wonder about this 'suspense' element, if we can call it that, in his pacing.  It's interesting because I hadn't thought about it, but I think this is what lies at the core of my problem with his pacing: the intention is muddled.  It's not a completely clear signal.  Mind you, I'm not against this, and will watch repeatedly the scene a bit after the bombs/planes fly overhead in Sacrifice, in which the Wife writhes bawling on the floor and switches languages every other line.  I'll watch it until I understand it, like I've listened to things umpteen times until I understand them.
I have qualms about depending on this from the audience, though.  This is getting a bit tangential, so...

this is a good point and exactly what I'm talking about in terms of a successful example.  I for one love his 'facial acting', if that's a term, when he first hits the grass.  Orgasmic and beautifully done!

There's another question... is his orchestration through-composed?  What do we see as orchestration and what is merely instrumentation?  Or a 'Tarkovsky cliche'? :) Thank you for the response.

This could be, but I have a hard time seeing silliness here.  Not that I haven't; I usually do!  But, I feel like I'm not being 'serious' enough and should get back to watching the movie.. ;)

Another vote for the Theater in the film, and by T himself.  I know where you are in the book, I think, and got the feeling that he was lamenting the dependency on editing.. ?  I think he uses editing often and very effectively.

I would suggest goin through my friends at

http://www.popco.com/film/hv/scarecrow/

This goes for anyone seeking Tarkovsky vid/laserdisc.  The owner is an avid Tarkovsky fan, having recently hosted a Tarkovsky festival in the store's makeshift theater!  Do drop them a line, I'm sure they'll know.

Hi,
	
	I agree with both of your comments in regards to T's vocab vs Hollywood's vocab.  I think it goes beyond that a bit, not much, but a bit.
Do you think if I was raised in India, North Africa, or Eastern Europe that I would have an easier time with the pacing?  I mention these countries because they are farther from Hollywood's grasp.  I think it's an interesting question, and one I'd like your input on.  I don't actively compare anything in T's work to Hollywood, of course, and doubt if I do so on much of a subliminal level anymore.  I had to drop any conventional models for music awhile ago, and think the same applies for film.  I don't think it's fair to assume everyone raised in America sees film through a Hollywood consciousness, do you?

Another important issue in regard to pacing is the relationship between the theater viewing and the video viewing.  I, for one, have only seen Solaris in a theater, and the rest on video.  The pacing is much easier to absorb in the theater, I think, because the image at the intended size is much easier to get lost in.  

PS I didn't point it out but I think this was very well said:
"The tendency for the uninflected shot (one shot = one message) means that
The shot in itself contains very little meaning, and we automatically
search for the edit point to glean information. It also stylises the
representation of reality on screen to a series of meaningful looks and
gestures to convey thought and emotion. It discards what is believed to be
extraneous time and space. But for what Tarkovsky tries to convey, the long
shot is the right 'tool'."

Excellent points Scott.  I especially dig the wording above.  May I quote it? 
The Adelaide example was the first I thought of as well.

I'd like to pose another question to the group, if we can have to conversations occur at once..  This one is not quite so subjective..

I am very taken with the economy of means T uses to acheive striking visual effects ie the crossfading of landscapes in Stalker, the filtered slowmo shot of water in Solaris..  I wonder what if anyone has info on how these were shot, or how related examples were shot?  More detail, at least, than what is apparent from the screen.  For me as an amateur filmmaker as well as a composer, this is one of the tastiest aspects of his filmmaking.

There are many shots of the ocean in Solaris that seem to simply be shots of water in slow motion, filtered to emphasize a certain color (usually green on my copy).  In Stalker, there is a section where the three fall asleep in the zone, and the zone changes while they sleep, from creek to different wet and dry environs and back to the original environment by the time they wake up.  It appears to me that Tark scouted many different locations for this shot with similar Topography (trees in the same spots in the frame) but different environmental conditions.  These kinds of simple ingenuity are sheer genius.

Well, you could apply any terminology you want ;)

But seriously, 
I don't know that T's 'moves' ie the speed he take sequences are consistent enough to call them this.  Legato could be interpreted as a sequence of shorter sections of film uniting as a "phrase", or you could apply it more 'microscopically, to mean said sequence consisting of overlapping, maybe cross-fading small sections..  Anyone else?  Those musical terms you mentioned, at least to this kid, have VERY classical overtones, which may/may not be appropriate to the film in question.  I prefer 'fast' 'slow' 'ragged' 'panting' etc. in other words, plain english.  

I think the "value" involved in using musical annotations would be to the person annotating.  You would organize your thoughts on the piece with such a technique. In such a case, who cares if it's of value to anyone else, go for it!

Hi Everyone!  I'm still alive but real busy.  Just had a couple of things to say:

First, I agree with this guy to a point.  I love the camerawork in DM and think it DOES owe a lot to AT, but Jim is too much of a goofball, I think, to sustain the mystique necessary for the time-distortion AT pulls off.  Don't get me wrong, Jim is MY MAN, very much so, but I think it'd be interesting to see him really try to pull off the pacing which his wit sometimes won't allow.  (wow, I guess I could keep backpedalling on that one, but it's a valid point, I guess)  Incidentally, I think JJ's TIGUERO is awesome as well, and attacks this question from a different standpoint.  He (Jim) and film director Sam Fuller go to a remote land inhabited by primitive peoples Sam had filmed 30 years previous.  The crux of the film lies in showing these people, who continue a primitive existence, the images of themselves (minus 30 yrs.) and their reactions.  Very thought-provoking.


Also, has anyone ordered the Tark/Artmeyev CD's from Forced Exposure???  Reviews?  Just in case you missed it, FE's website is: 

http://www.fe.org/

...and they allegedly are distributing a reissue of the Artmeyev CD's from that Japanese label that reissued them a little while back... um..  not very helpful am I?  But check the website under Andrei Tarkovsky and they'll come up.. 
Take care everybody!

NTSC stands for National Television Standards Committee,
or if you please Never Twice the Same Color. 

NTSC is the first and oldest commercial TV Color Standard, and being 
such, it incorporates a lot of compromises, which technically considered 
to be drawbacks, as opposed to the European standards, which were 
developed later in early 60's. PAL used in most of Western Europe, and 
SECAM, developed in France is still in use there as well as in 
ex-communist countries and in some Middle East countries. PAL and SECAM 
are partly compatible, resulting in Black and White playback of PAL 
videosignals on SECAM sets and vice versa. However those systems are not 
compatible with the NTSC standard.
By the way there is nothing illegal in converting PAL to NTSC, as such.
Anyway most of Kieslowsky is available in the States .
Just check with www.amazon.com, www.kencranes.com, www.reelcom.com among 
the others

Thomas,
A video store in San Francisco, Le Video, has THE DECALOUGE for rent on VHS
tape, converted from the British PAL release.  It's all subtitled in
English.  They also have A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING and A SHORT FILM ABOUT
LOVE, as well as  many other PAL-converted films that are unavailable in
the US.  Check out their website at www.levideo.com.  I have the whole
DECALOGUE on tape, so if you need a dupe, I can help you out.

Wow! That was deep. Sorry for that outburst, I'll be back in few hours 
for that disussion. Kudos for bringing in that topic. I think it is one 
of the best of this summer's postings. I am not familiar with "...a 
visual fougue" and I admit I have been somehow reluctant about it. Right 
now I am ordering it from Amazon.com.
Cheers

Hey Pavel!


I'm very happy to get your perspective. I suspected that such customs
were normal. (Still, the anecdote about B kissing T in public and
causing people to stare does seem peculiar) Anyway as I've said before,
I wonder why Johnson and Petrie make the assertion in their book that
Russia is extremely homophobic? Suggesting that we in the West are less
so?


<paraindent><param>right,left</param><italic>Visual Fugue</italic> P
17: "His bisexuality remains a well hidden secret in the extremely
homophobic Russian Society."


Also:<italic> Visual Fugue</italic> P 248: "While most of the other
facts of his private life were well known to insiders, his apparent
bisexuality is only now being quietly discussed. Was this the "deep,
dark evil" that tormented him (Rerberg interview), that he could not
share with anyone in the extremely homophobic Soviet society?

</paraindent>

I quote these not as evidence of T's sexual behaviour but because of
the references to Soviet and Russian homophobia. Of course I don't
trust everything I read in their book (or anyone else's) and it's
easily conceivable to me that the subject is ill conceived.


Yes I've read a bit, watched some films, followed the careers of a few
Russian artists, hell I even subscribed to "Soviet Life" for years and
I still don't know anything, that's why I said in an earlier post that
I <italic>thought</italic> it was common for men to be more
affectionate to one another, much more than we are here in the States.
Thanks again for verifying this, personally.


It's led me to wonder if we humans feel more free to show affection
when there is some assurance that our love will not be taken as
something sexual? Such configurations of taboos and customs may serve
to actually allow us to feel closer to one another without the
relationship becoming intimate. Providing a society with more
affectionate behavior could not be a bad idea, to show our love for one
another as a part of our custom... it remains social not personal.


In this respect I think the term "homophobic" is decidedly prejudiced.
But perhaps it's difficult to ingrain such definitive lines in our
behavior without fear and anxiety that we find associated with the term
"Taboo". 


But I think these social conventions are in a way a kind of heightened
respect for privacy. Here in the US our sense of privacy has been
completely exploited, mostly I think by Television. We all have a sense
that we live in one another's homes. If there is no respectable sense
of privacy then everything personal about us has no where to belong,
its nothing short of apocalyptic.  And this aspect is something T was
very concerned with in his later films.


Not sure what you mean by "boulevard shit" but I like it. What is
"boulevard shit"? The place where people walk their house pets? A
gathering place on the street where losers hang out to gab and try and
impress one another? Is it a Russian colloquialism? I've never heard it
but whatever it means I like the phrase. As soon as I finish my PHD in
pedantry*, I'm there, thats where I'll be.



>> tragic transformation of B's personality under pressure of his parts

First, I spread rumors that Tarkovsky was a fag, now you say he was
hypnotizing people into becoming Fascists?  Boy we ought to get some
good replys to this. Hope we don't get kicked off the list and miss the
fireworks.


Seriously, this is amazing news and I think you have a very valid
point. For one thing, I can see it as an example of what I was talking
about before: what happens when the distinction between one's public
behavior overwhelms the very precarious private identity. Also,
appropriate to what you've described about B's tropism it occurs to me
that B's become a negative of Roublev: where Roublev was conditioned by
the oppressions into a sublime artist, B is conditioned by the sublime
to become an oppressor. Very Tarkovskian. (viz. Domenico)


One last note: It's not my intention to talk about T's sexuality, I
hope our discussion is about issues of identity, psychology and the
experiences of life in, out and around nature's body. The incarnation,
if you will.


There are timeless traditions... mythic, heroic, and esoteric which
involve sexual transgressions, transmigrations and transformations for
important reasons. These have little to do with the mentality of
gossip. I am convinced as you are by the content of the films that T
was not interested in the sexual act per se, but was deeply affected by
the problem of being a sexualised being. His eyes were indeed on the
sky... but note: he never directed <italic>our </italic>gaze there. He
didn't need to. Even in puddles of mud one can find reflective surfaces
for the earth's counterpart.  


S


*Not to be confused with "pederasty", S'il vous plait.

I have written something to the same effect, but then decided, ah, this
thread should die by itself. However, what picks attention now, is that it
seems to be very in line with the amazing western ability to turn any
outstanding points in the foreign culture into a pulp fiction. Be that a
"troubled space station Mir", Chechnia, or Tarkovsky.

What do you think would be Tarkovsky's place in current Russia?

Hey Tarden


Good to hear from you. The Mann book sounds like news. Do you have any
specifics... publisher, ISBN, editor? I'd like to look at it if I get
time.


By the way, I ran across an idea the other day that might be of
interest to both you and Thomas B.


I was looking into Milton and found that he orchestrates
<italic>Paradise Lost</italic> so that it ends in privacy rather than
in some external or public manner. And then, of course, I thought of
Tarkovsky.


As the story goes, Satan is doing all he can to bring about the
corruption of God's creation and when he succeeds at the end it is very
simply played out between a man and a woman ...in private they are
tempted and they commit the tiny deed. Very small and insignificant.
They take, hand in hand, to "their solitary way".


Thomas did an interpretation of <italic>Nastolghia</italic> some months
back wherein he suggested that the candle scene at the end was a kind
of "harrowing of hell" and it's a thought that has stuck with me. I
think it connects with this schematic of Milton's. 


Gorchakov's action is diametrically opposed to Domenico's public act.
I've always liked the fact that G is not a man of "faith" yet he
performs his faithful duty with an acute since of it's absurdity. His
little routine in the pool has no oratory, no explanation. He makes no
attempt to justify it. He clearly looks embarrassed in front of the few
people that we see nearby him as he strolls to and fro through the
pool. 


I'll keep it short (!) here and finish by saying Milton's account of
the fall seems related because Domenico told G that if he carried the
candle into the pool it would mean the salvation of everyone.


So my list of texts I find contiguous to <italic>Nastolghia</italic>
continues to grow!


<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>Say first, for heav'n
hides nothing from thy view,

Nor the deep tract of hell; say first, what cause

Moved our grand parents in that happy state,

Favoured of heav'n so highly, to fall off


</paraindent>The original broken home....

	As you of course understand, russians are not one on whole thing.
BUT of course some statements should be done. Homosexuality was a criminal
offence (with great years of imprisonment) till 1997. Some artist I believe
you know were charged (I mean Paradjanov). However, in dissident part of
society being  homo never  was a sign of a protest. I think because soviet
machine very succsesfully depressed all forms of public sexual expression
and no one just thought about it. As the result, when SU crashed in
non-educated part of society an opinion has formed, that homosexuals are
some sort of aliens. No fobia -- ignorance. By the way I' ve been attacked
several times by the drunk people on the grounds that I look like fagot (by
the way I am not). I' ve been four times in US and never noticed such
things. More advenced people are absolutely tolerant.

Hurray Pavel,

When the subject came (again, should I say?) I first though I should 
ignore it.( I still remember the wild discussion on the AT message 
board). But then the flood came, so I will quote someone else:

«Often critics speak and write as if their interpretations were the last 
word, presuming that their insights, like bridges from artists to 
audiences, close the door to meaning, and thenceforth no dog should 
bark. But that should be very far indeed from the function of the 
interpreter. Obviously, the ardor a critic brings to the study and 
discussion to certain work reveals much about the critic himself, and in 
setting forth particular themes, images, ideas and concerns in the art 
of Alfred Hitchcock — works everywhere full of passion — there is no 
escaping a certain self-discovery and self-revelation. To such dangers 
the act of interpretation is always prey.»
(Quoted from «THE ART OF ALFRED HITCHCOCK—fifty years of his motion 
pictures» by Donald Spoto)


The art of Andrei Tarkovsky remains obscured to the wast majority of 
movie-goers, probably because the infamous language barrier, and even 
the critics rely on inadequate dialogue translations for their work. 
Also, they often fail to understand the real nature of «homo sovieticus» 
and the society that surrounds it.

As for Russian men kissing each other on the cheks without being 
suspect, either you must be kidding, or you don’t even begin to suspect, 
how homophobic Russian society relly is. If you refer to the past Soviet 
leaders, they never represented typical Russian «mujhik», though most of 
them were born and raised in patriarchal and country (agricultural) 
parts of Russia

Speaking of Sartorius?


In Lem's book it was a Negress for Gibarian, a little girl for 
Sartorius, and nothing identified for Snaut.

In Tarkovsky's film it was a readhead girl fot Gibarian, a midget for 
Sartorius (what about Dr. Mengele?), {sorry, little person}, and an 
unidentified ear in a hammock for Snaut ( a kid? a woman?)

When a critic says something about any work of art, or a particular 
artist, he never "means anything" and it never "does anything for him". 
Then why does he say it in the first place?

Hey Pavel, thanks for being lucid about this topic. 


By the way, I just have to say I have very high esteem for Parajonov's
work. Have you seen the documentary made just before he died? At the
end he accepts an award -- I forget where the festival is -- but
instead of giving an acceptance speech he decides to have a minute of
silence in honor of Tarkovsky who had just died. 

 


The way I understand homophobia is not in terms of violent aggression
but in the mental reflexes, how we jump to conclusions simply for self
defense. I do this myself, thats why I know about it. 


I've been around homosexuality since I was very young, I grew up in the
southern US, in a backward town that was crawling with people who are
not "advanced people". ("Shy People" was filmed near there,
coincidentaly) I too was constantly harassed for looking "like a gurl".
In that atmosphere my mother opened a gay night club when I was in high
school. I was not particularly proud of it, but on the other hand ...I
was sort of proud, you know? 


I had plenty of opportunity to explore my own sexual tendencies. My
very best friend through out high school was gay. Yet around me he
played it straight. My reason for having him as a friend was because he
was intelligent. A perceptive person. He had a very vital mind, which I
find very rare and value greatly, regardless of who they fuck. I speak
of him in the past tense because he died years ago... you can guess
how.


I am certainly capable of being repressed -- as some have suggested
here on the list. I never thought that my friend Carl was gay
throughout the years that we spent together. He told me after we
graduated, and I was surprised. I realize now that I was keeping this
knowledge from myself, to protect myself, to protect our friendship. In
a way it was a kind of tacit agreement -- although he was conscious of
the arrangement and I was not.


This was a very subtle form of homophobia. It was not antagonistic, as
you can see. Still it was an unconscious fear that led me to a slightly
distorted view of reality. I bet I still have a slightly distorted view
of reality. I'm a great deal more self aware now than I was twenty
years ago, but I still find that my mind takes care of things with out
telling me all the details. I think this is normal.

</paraindent>

No you didn't choose the wrong word, I think your English is very good.
I was simply trying to make a joke. I thought it was very funny! The
idea that Tarkovsky is hypnotizing people into being fascists had me
laughing all day. I had this image in my head of a stern Tarkovsky
standing in between Tesla coils, arms outstretched.... 


And I did think you had an interesting point. But fascism is another
very complex subject. Have you read Susan Sontag's essay "Fascinating
Fascism"? In it she suggests that certain artistic expressions are
indicative of fascism: Art Deco, the Symbolists, she even mentions a
few films <italic>Fantasia</italic>, Kubrick's <italic>2001</italic>. I
see what she's talking about , though I don't agree with her
conclusion.


I've often wondered what she would say about Tarkovsky's aesthetics.


S

What's wrong with being a fag anyway?  Since nobody else seems willing to take
the job, I will officially volunteer to be a big fat queer.  I get to hang out
with Plato, Oscar wilde, Leonardo Da Vinci, Freud, Foucault, Sappho, Gertrude
Stein, and the stratospherically talented Ellen DeGeneres.  You heteros can
join the ranks of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Robespierre, and Ted Bundy.

Scott, you write:

<< Gorchakov's action is diametrically opposed to Domenico's public act.
 I've always liked the fact that G is not a man of "faith" yet he
 performs his faithful duty with an acute since of it's absurdity. His
 little routine in the pool has no oratory, no explanation. He makes no
 attempt to justify it. He clearly looks embarrassed in front of the few
 people that we see nearby him as he strolls to and fro through the
 pool.  >>

Good stuff. I was thinking that this is also applicable to Alexander's
discussion of changing the world by repeating a single act every day in The
Sacrifice. Note in Nost. just how little Tark makes of the audience--we see
that G is embarrassed, but we don't see the people watching him until after
G's death. Despite the public setting, Tark clearly chooses to make this act a
personal one. Tying Tark to Milton other than thematically is a bit of a
stretch--which is to say, that I doubt Tark was alluding to PL or anything. 

I've only just come back within the last day or so--has this Tark as bi-sexual
thing been going on the whole time I was gone? 

As per the new Death in Venice translation, I'll look it up next time I'm in
the bookstore where I saw it and post all relevant info. It looked like it was
pretty recent.

Dear subsribers:

I'd like to take a stand and clarify some of the questions. First, a
little bit about myself. I was born and raised in Russia, spent their
the best years of my life. Now I'm living in the U.S. I loved some of
the comments and analysis made by Tony, Scott, and Vladimir about
Tarkovsky and his Films, still a little bit confused though about an
amazing level of devotion expressed by people who don't speak Russian
and know about the culture only from books.
1. Homophobia in Russia. Homosexuals are still opressed and treated with
disrespect. They are publicly humiliated and have been the butts (so to
speak) of jokes for years. However, men do kiss each other. I'm not gay
(not that there's anything wrong with it), but, being under the
influence of alcoholic beverages and being very happy, I've kissed my
buddies in public on numerous occasions. I've also kissed my dad, my
relatives, close friends, and a couple of dogs (just kidding). All my
letters to friends I still end with "Love you". I think it brings people
closer together. 
2. Church. Despite on the communism and despite on constant agression,
Christian Churches have always existed and funcioned. My father is a
scientist and my mother is a psychologist, still I was baptized at my
birth and given a cross that I still have. People have always gone to
churches, the communist allowed most of the churches to function. So,
anyone could've gone to the church on Sunday morning. Although it was
usually done in secrecy and by more common people (communist leaders of
any rank weren't advised to go to the church). Younger generation didn't
believe in God very much, so any one saying that he does could've been
laughed at and wasn't taken seriously. It also meant the end of your
career (in terms of promotions and growth). I can understand the tragedy
of Tarkovsky, who sincerely believed  and loved God, but has not been
able to express that love. His Films did. 
3. In heated discussions about cinematography of Tarkovsky's films,
there are many details about the scenery, shots, references to his
personal life, actors and so on. To me, besides being a great director,
Tarkovsky, first of all, was a great spiritual leader and enlightener.
His films are glowing with love for people, and Christianity, and
spirituality, and care, and.... just watch them again. Without looking
at the actors, but looking at the people.

Sincerely Yours,
Greg.

hello everyone, i am new here, but i saw something which you said Greg, 
which i liked, and which reminded me rather of an anecdote someone told 
me last week. You said:

>His films are glowing with love for people, and Christianity, and
>spirituality, and care, and.... just watch them again. Without looking
>at the actors, but looking at the people.

In sydney a tramp had some kind of spiritual awakening and went 
everywhere with a little piece of chalk. He would write, on walls, on 
pavements - anywhere - the word "eternity". People, apparently, would 
see this word, and would stop and think over their whole lives and the 
direction in which civilisation is moving. I discussed the story with my 
friend and we both agreed that the word affected people because of the 
love behind it, the faith behind it. And you see, it is still affecting 
people, because my friend told me that story and now i am writing about 
it.
Tarkovsky only made a few films, but what i like about this website (or 
whatever it is called) is that it takes its cue from that small body of 
work and allows people to express themselves with passion to one 
another, whether it is about films or homosexuality. I heard another 
anecdote recently - an aboriginal man was walking along a street with 
the author of a book i read, and the author was praising the archetects 
of some of sydney's skyscrapers. The aboriginal man suggested that 
perhaps the love or power to create the buildings was present in the 
paper used for the drawings and the bricks used for the building, rather 
than the archetects themselves - who were merely just syphons for what 
was around them. I like the idea that Tarkovsky's films contain so much 
belief and love that any arguments or conversations we have sort of feed 
off it. 
This is perhaps a little bit eccentric though. 

william kremer

To 'Natalia Marchev/Sydney SPL/Group' and whom it may concern,

I can't manage to get you off the list, 'cause the address through which you
post to the list is not considered as a 'member' of the list. Please go to:

http://www.knoware.nl/users/rhune/tarkovsky.html

and do it yourself with the correct address. When you still have problems, do
mail me personally at rhune@knoware.nl and do NOT mail to the list.

I'll try to configure the list to make it even more easier to leave the list
when people want to.

Also it is not a bad idea to save your welcome message when you join the list,
it contains precise instructions...

<x-rich>Hey Seamus


Well I'm terribly sorry for this long post I found some fun things
today.

</paraindent>

Yes and the apocalyptic aspect of <italic>Sacrifice</italic> is also
appropriate, I think.


Isn't the crowd at the end very strange? It's like the conclusion of
the "story", Gorchakov dies and: "its a wrap!"... something like
Jodorowsky's<italic> Holy Mountain</italic> or Parajonov's <italic>Red
Pomegranates</italic>, we are shown the film set, the camera
(respectively). No we don't actually see a film crew at the end of the
pool but still I don't think they are villagers or hotel patrons. They
seem to be the film's audience, not Gorchakov's. Tarkovsky's. The
object and subjects merge, as we merge with the audience. 


Domenico's audience was a construction, an arrangement of the deranged.
Very dramatic, and magical. The trick of seeing someone set them self
on fire and burn to death in a long take is obviously the work of a
magician. T employed traditional magic tricks all the time, he most
likely thought of himself to be a part of the magical tradition of
Melies or Welles. But the magic of Gorchakov's death was occult and
confusing. Subject and object become tropes. Motives produce a causal
results - only when Gorchacov acts without understanding, without an
eye toward his artistic patrons ... he connects to the universal. 


Being a magician in modern times T also manages to deconstruct the
magic show, to expose the man behind the curtain and still engage us in
participation mystique. 

 

Two extensive quotes are somewhat elliptical but to shed light on
Nastolghia in strange ways. I hope they also might mean something to
you and others.


This is from Robert Eisler's Orpheus - The Fisher p203:

<paraindent><param>right,left</param>

<smaller><smaller>First of all, the belief in the efficacy of
complementary purgings of the soul through the hostile elements of
water, air and fire is common to all the Hellenistic mysteries. Before
the initiate of Apuleius is deemed worthy to approach the divinity, he
has to '<italic>travel through all the elements</italic>.' On the other
hand, in Virgil's mystic description of the underworld we hear that
some of the souls are purified by being exposed to the winds - even as
Paolo and Francesca in Dante's purgatory; the wickedness of others is
washed away by water, while still others are purged through fire. To
this passage Servius, the learned commentator of the Aeneid, adds the
following instructive words:


</smaller></smaller></paraindent><smaller><smaller><paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>"Every
purgation is effected either by water or by fire or by air; therefore
in all the mysteries you find these three methods of cleansing: they
either disinfect you with (burning) sulphur, or wash you with water, or
ventilate you with wind; the latter is done in the Dionysiac
mysteries."

</paraindent><paraindent><param>right,left</param>

Alluding evidently to the use of the mystic winnowing shovel
(<italic>liknon</italic>) by the Bacchic initiates.

</paraindent>


</smaller></smaller>Now this is a series of thoughts, statements from
... well for now I'd rather not say for now who he is, I was very
surprised at the insight he had into cinema given that he is known for
his work in another medium. His thoughts deserve to be heard free of
prejudice.



<paraindent><param>right,left</param><smaller>Robert Baker, an
Edinburgh artist, while in jail for debt, was struck by the effect of
light shining through the bars of his cell through a letter he was
reading, and out of this perception he invented the first
<italic>Panorama</italic>, a concave, transparent picture view of the
city.



This invention was soon replaced by the Diorama, which added the
illusion of movement by shifting the room. Also sounds and novel
lighting effects. Daguerre's London Diorama still stands in Regent's
Park, a rare survival, since these shows depended always on effects of
artificial light, produced by lamps or gas jets, and nearly always
ended in fire.


Phantasmagoria, magic lantern shows, spectacles without substance. They
achieved complete sensory experiences through noise, incense,
lightning, water. There may be a time when we'll attend Weather
Theaters to recall the sensation of rain.


Cinema has evolved in two paths.



One is spectacle. Like the Phantasmagoria, its goal is the creation of
a total substitute sensory world.



The other is peep show, which claims for its realm both the erotic and
the untampered observance of real life, and imitates the keyhole or
voyeur's window without need of color, noise, grandeur.


Cinema derives not from painting, literature, sculpture, theater, but
from ancient popular wizardry. It is the contemporary manifestation of
an evolving history of shadows, a delight in pictures that move, a
belief in magic. Its lineage is entwined from the earliest beginning
with Priests and sorcery, a summoning of phantoms. With, at first, only
slight aid of the mirror and fire, men called up dark and secret visits
from regions in the buried mind. In these seances, shades are spirits
which ward off evil.


The Spectator is a dying animal.

 

Through ventriloquism, gestures, play with objects, and all rare
variations of the body in space, the shaman signaled his "trip" to an
audience which shared the journey.


In the seance, the shaman led. A sensuous panic deliberately evoked
through drugs, chants, dancing hurls the shaman into trance. Changed
voice, convulsive movement. He acts like a madman. These professional
hysterics, chosen precisely for their psychotic leaning, were once
esteemed. They mediated between man and spirit-world. Their mental
travels formed the crux of the religious life of the tribe.


Principle of seance: to cure illness. A mood might overtake a people
burdened by historical events or dying in a bad landscape. They seek
deliverance from doom, death, dread. Seek possession, the visit of gods
and powers, a rewinning of the life source from demon possessors. The
cure is culled from ecstasy. Cure illness or prevent its visit, revive
the sick, and regain stolen, soul.


It is wrong to assume that art needs the spectator in order to be. The
film runs on without any eyes. The spectator cannot exist without it.
It insures his existence.


Metamorphose. An object is cut off from its name, habits, associations.
Detached, it becomes only the thing, in and of itself. When this
disintegration into pure existence is at last achieved, the object is
free to become endlessly anything.


The subject says "I see first lots of things which dance . . . then
everything becomes gradually connected."


Early film makers, who-like the alchemists- delighted in a willful
obscurity about their craft, in order to withhold their skills from
profane onlookers.



Separate, purify, reunite. The formula of Ars Magna, and its heir, the
cinema.



The camera is androgynous machine, a kind of mechanical hermaphrodite.


In his retort the alchemist repeats the work of Nature.


The alchemists detect in the sexual activity of man a correspondence
with the world's creation, with the growth of plants, and with mineral
formations. When they see the union of rain and earth, they see it in
an erotic sense, as copulation. And this extends to all natural realms
of matter. For they can picture love affairs of chemicals and stars, a
romance of stones, or the fertility of fire.


Strange, fertile correspondences the alchemists sensed in unlikely
orders of being. Between men and planets, plants and gestures, words
and weather. These disturbing connections: an infant's cry and the
stroke of silk; the whorl of an ear and an appearance of dogs in the
yard; a woman's head lowered in sleep and the morning dance of
cannibals; these are conjunctions which transcend the sterile signal of
any "willed" montage. These juxtapositions of objects, sounds, actions,
colors, weapons, wounds, and odors shine in an unheard-of way,
impossible ways.



Film is nothing when not an illumination of this chain of being which
makes a needle poised in flesh call up explosions in a foreign
capital.


Cinema returns us to anima, religion of matter,  which gives each thing
its special  divinity and sees gods in all things and beings Cinema, 
heir of alchemy, last of an erotic science.


</smaller></paraindent><smaller>

Well now there's more! Please bear with me I'm doing some serious
procrastinating here. You wrote:



</smaller><paraindent><param>right,right,right,left,left,left</param>Tying
Tark to Milton other than thematically is a bit of a

>stretch--which is to say, that I doubt Tark was alluding to PL or
anything.

</paraindent>

My dear departed friend Ioan Couliano has some thoughts on this:




<paraindent><param>right,left</param> <smaller>Intertextuality means
"transmission" in a very complex way. All previous experiences seem to
converge and deeply influence what we believe to be a new, fresh
experience. This convergence mainly happens below the threshold of
consciousness, and it presupposes a mental synthesis of many elements,
an active processing of the new occurrence that is not the mere
repetition of anything past. 


In history, transmission is usually viewed as a process in which
someone reads and rereads a text and then repeats it to others, often
in a distorted way. In reality things are far from being so simple.
Sometimes texts never show up in the transmission of ideas, even if
they exist; sometimes a general hermeneutical principle is casually or
furtively passed on to someone else, who then produces texts according
to this rule, and not according to any previous text, which is in fact
unknown to him or her. Yet the final result in each case can be very
close to texts that circulate in the community of the original
transmitters. Historians therefore conclude that transmission is based
on texts. 


They would be surprised to find out that the explanation is a simpler
one, unexplored by their methods: people think, and if they have a
pattern for their thinking, they produce thoughts predictable from the
outset. In many of the cases that form the object of our analysis,
transmission took place without actual circulation of texts;
"intertextuality" is thus a mental phenomenon, and concerns "texts"
sometimes written but usually unwritten.


Yet, with the help of ethnosemiotics, we can establish that human
beings had beliefs concerning other worlds long before they could
write. Ethnosemiotics analyzes systems of signs without regard to their
time setting. It can thus establish- and as a matter of fact it has-
that Paleosiberian cave paintings already show all the traits of a
developed shamanistic complex as we still find them displayed by some
Siberian shamans. To speak about texts under these circumstances would
be preposterous. Beliefs about other worlds and patterns of
otherworldly journeys were surely transmitted along the lines of
cultural tradition. The Italian scholar Carlo Ginzburg, who studied
European witchcraft for twenty-five years, came to the conclusion that
witchcraft was still practiced in certain zones of eastern Europe at
the end of the nineteenth century as a direct derivative of shamanism.
Beliefs recorded in Paleosiberian caves around 1000 B.C.E. were still
valid less than a hundred years ago. How can we explain such amazing
continuity?

Scott, you write:

<< Isn't the crowd at the end very strange? It's like the conclusion of
 the "story", Gorchakov dies and: "its a wrap!"... something like
 Jodorowsky's<italic> Holy Mountain</italic> or Parajonov's <italic>Red
 Pomegranates</italic>, we are shown the film set, the camera
 (respectively). No we don't actually see a film crew at the end of the
 pool but still I don't think they are villagers or hotel patrons. They
 seem to be the film's audience, not Gorchakov's. Tarkovsky's. The
 object and subjects merge, as we merge with the audience. 
  >>

I like this idea, but have to say that I never got this impression. I
distinctly remember seeing one of the women from earlier in the movie in the
crowd at the end. I remember her only because she looks exactly like the
mother of an old friend. Still, there is an odd sense to the villagers in
general--the gossipers in the pool at the beginning is a favorite scene. Just
a bunch of talking heads bobbing around in the water. In a sense they couldbe
stand-ins for the audience in the end, in that they are witnessing the scene
with a good deal more compassion than Domenico's witnesses. After all, unlike
the city folk in Rome, the townspeople actually do run to help Gorchakov.

<<Cinema derives not from painting, literature, sculpture, theater, but
from ancient popular wizardry. It is the contemporary manifestation of
an evolving history of shadows, a delight in pictures that move, a
belief in magic. Its lineage is entwined from the earliest beginning

slight aid of the mirror and fire, men called up dark and secret visits
from regions in the buried mind. In these seances, shades are spirits

If you like this idea there is a novel by social critic Theodore Roszak called
Flicker that you might enjoy. Via a pretty good conspiracy plot it constructs
an alternate history of cinema that derives it's origins from the Egyptian
priesthood and Knights Templar. Sort of a Foucault's Pendulum of film history.
I wonder if Roszak hadn't read this passage--he must have.

<<It is wrong to assume that art needs the spectator in order to be. The
film runs on without any eyes. The spectator cannot exist without it.
It insures his existence.>>

There is, I think, (as Tallulah Bankhead once quipped) "less to this than
meets the eye." Certainly the spectator cannot be a spectator unless he/she is
seeing something--but that does not negate the fact that film needs spectators
to exist. A chair is not really a chair unless someone exists to sit in it. Or
is it? This is a Platonic take on things, I guess. It is not the individual
function and use of the item, but the ideal item itself that defines it . . .
I.E. A chair is a chair even when there are no bipeds in existence who can sit
in it. Art does not need the spectator in order to BE, but it certainly needs
the spectator in order to be ART. I guess that's the distinction I'd make.
Otherwise it's just celluloid.

<<Metamorphose. An object is cut off from its name, habits, associations.
Detached, it becomes only the thing, in and of itself. When this
disintegration into pure existence is at last achieved, the object is
free to become endlessly anything.>>

More cleverness. The assumption here seems to be that a thing is not in a
state of pure existence if it is bound to labels, uses, etc. Pure existence,
it would seem to me, would be just such bindings and associations. Being, by
which I mean the state of being, is not the ability to become "endlessly
anything"--but the state of being SOMETHING, even several things. Being
anything is, ultimately, the same as being nothing--i.e. not existing at all.
Even the above quote requires "disintegration" for "pure existence" to
occur--a bit of a paradox, no?

As per your occultish response to the idea that Tarkovsky was probably not
directly alluding to MIlton--you raise some interesting points in your
quotation. And I'll certainly concede that Tark may have been influenced by
MIlton's ideas, both directly and indirectly. But I would also point out that
these ideas by no means begin with MIlton who was, himself, dealing with the
Bible and the Classical authors. Which brings us back to the idea that, I
think (hope), I did concede in the first place, namely that Tark and Milton
seemed similar in their thinking. Influence is always a tricky issue--some
allusions are blatant, others subtle, others inadvertent. I think your
connection of Mann's Death in Venice to Nostalghia some time ago (that was
you, wasn't it Scott?) is a good example of either subtle or inadvertent
influence. The presence of religious painting and orthodox ideas (such as
Thomas is one to point out) are usually blatant or subtle. The Milton
connection seems to me at the very least unconscious, if not simply the result
of similar thinking (with, albeit a common basis.)

Phew.

Glad to hear that all this bickering about homo/bi sexuality hasn't been the
sole occupation of the group over last couple of months. And yes, I do
remember how people jump the gun and get all pissed off about some of the
topics.

I'll check up on that Mann for you later today. It looks pretty damned
promising.

Alright, here it is:

Death in Venice and Other Stories published in 1998 by Viking Press.

at $18.17. 400 pp. Other stories include: "Tonio Kruger", "Harsh Hour," "The
Will For Happiness," "Blood of the Walsungs," "Little Lizzy" and "Gladius
Dei."

Anyhow, if anyone can speak to the quality of this new translation I would be
grateful.

i can make an extremely superficial call on that (having never read much 
of jn's translations); he's supposed to be good. he's done joseph roth's
radezky march and a new set of kafka short story translations that
received a fair amount of praise. 

but then again, i'm not quite qualified to make the call on how it will
actually turn out.

Thank you--this is more than I had to go on before. The recent string of John
Woods translations over the past few years of Mann's work have been excellent.
(Buddenbrooks, Magic Mountain, Doctor Faustus) but I had not heard of JN until
this new DIV was released. Any info is appreciated.

Yes, that as far as I'm concerned Eisenstein never got to edit the
film he shot. I don't remember if before or after the national tourism
department used them for promotional means, another person (I guess
his assistant) put the material together the closest possible to
Eisenstein's original plans.
But there's no actual original version, completely done by him.

Please, anyone correct me if I'm wrong.

Just saw Sakarov's Mother-Son and was very disappointed. He's obviously
influenced by Tarkovsky, but with Sakarov it's all superficial. The images
were --dare I say--cliche (e.g. dark clouds for brooding).  All style,
little substance.  Few words (like Tark) but the words weren't meaningful.
I hope Angelopolous, who I've read is somewhat like Tarkovsky, doesn't turn
out to be such a disappointement.

<x-rich>Hello Greg


Thanks so much for taking the time to offer your personal point of
view, helping to cultivate the sense of humor in this thread of thought
... while also respecting the seriousness of our intentions.


One striking similarity in your description of Christianity in Russia
sounds very familiar: "Younger generation didn't believe in God very
much, so anyone saying that he does could've been laughed at and wasn't
taken seriously." It seems that adolescent cynicism and hostility
haunts us all.

<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>

>  I loved some of

>the comments and analysis made by Tony, Scott, and Vladimir about

>Tarkovsky and his Films, still a little bit confused though about an

>amazing level of devotion expressed by people who don't speak Russian

>and know about the culture only from books.

</paraindent>

So many assertions, opinions and tangents coming from us Americans must
surely feel like a  disregard for Tarkovsky as the cultural hero he is
to many Russians. It's gotta be annoying to more than a few of you. Of
course we do not intend on stealing him away; even still, we (I) should
be more sensitive. I know this is not the main point of your message
but it's a subject I want consider more closely... personally.


It's so easy for us Americans to miss how our preoccupation with T
would come off like a misappropriation. I thank you sincerely for your
graciousness when we transgress and I apologize for my ignorant
<italic>faux pas</italic>.  


Anyway here's a piece I find related in a way. It's an excerpt from a
letter I received a few months ago from a friend who teaches English
Literature. It's an interesting account of a kind of a similar
situaltion. 


<paraindent><param>right,left</param>I went to the Faulkner Conference
back in the summer of 1987, had dinner (fried

chicken and watermelon) on the grounds at Faulkner's house, observed
the pencil

scribblings he had done on the walls of his study; he had the habit of
writing

outlines to his novels there.  Four Russian Faulkner experts gave a
seminar and

were very interesting.  They were from the "Gorky Institute of World
Literature" in Moscow and had been studying English and Faulkner for 20
years and knew more

about Faulkner than the Mississipians who were there.  They talked
about the

parallels between the Russian peasant and the rural Mississippi
characters in

Faulkner's stuff.

</paraindent>

Perhaps none of us are as unique as we feel, subjectively. At any rate,
I wish our dialogues could be free from threat and suspicion, but
that's human nature. Needless to say but saying it anyway, I would be
ludicrous to suggest that any of us Americuns on the list know more
about T than his home boys. The reason I'm here is I enjoy the
exchange, sometimes we make discoveries that are very exciting. Please
don't take the enthusiasm as arrogance or an advance. As for myself I'm
not as convinced as I may often sound. The tone of authority can carry
a voice far but to me it's like a good BM, when it's over we all look
back and wonder where it came from. 


This Faulkner story made me think about my own contradictions. My
immediate response to the image of listening to a bearded professor
full of Stolichnaya*, pontificating about Faulkner's use of the local
Negresses is ... it makes me giggle. 


But I have to admit I would drop everything (except my flask) and be
the first in line (which would be comparatively short in this country).
Most of all, this anectdote is sobering. We all know that Faulkner's
work (as all artists') has a dimension other than the medium - In
Faulkner's case: the written (or spoken) word. It appears from my
friend's point of view that this other dimension is a valid one to him
as well, maybe the most valid of all. 



Now my bit of my auto bio.


I've had an attraction to Russia for as long as I can remember knowing
about the country. I remember taking my mother's copy of <italic>The
Idiot</italic>  off the shelf and staring at the strange cover ... too
young to read it, of course. Now it seems like fate.


I still smile when I remember the very moment, the time and place when
I first read those words..."I am a sick man". It was 18 years ago, I
was sitting on a grassy levee by the beautiful Ouachita river. A region
quite close to Faulkner's, actually, geographically and culturally. But
the moment was memorable <italic>not </italic>because of where I
was,<italic> not</italic> because I had eaten a watermelon, but because
of what I found: <italic>I knew this man</italic>. 


Faulkner I respected outwardly, Dostoyevsky I
<italic>recognized</italic> internally.

 

Five years later I saw a film that was even closer to me. Isn't it
strange that I would tell my wife-to-be that I understood nothing at
all about what I had seen even though I felt a familiarity unlike any
other film? It's two different kinds of knowing, isn't it?


Carl Jung was once asked if he had faith. He smiled and said:
"Faith...? I know ...<italic>I know</italic>." There is quite a lot
about your wonderful country that I will never get around to knowing.
Hell even in my own small world I struggle to understand the simplest
things: math, remote controls, pornography... but one thing I feel very
fortunate to know -just a little- is .... well, me and William's
derelict Aussie: <bold>eternity</bold>. It doesn't take much of it to
make an impression and coming as it does in small and spare doses it's
easy to miss.


Jung spent most of his carreer trying to express what it was that he
<italic>knew</italic>... I think the consensus is: he failed. There are
a few people who are able to communicate something about it...very few.
I'm not one of them. I'm a stranger there so I feel <italic>very
fortunate</italic> when I connect to someone who can show me around.
The culture of Russia is a subject of its own, it's a subject I'm
attracted to, but that <italic>other</italic> country is what it all
comes down to for me. That place where distinctions of language, race
and sex mean <italic>nothing</italic>, that's where I long to spend my
free time. Maybe because I suspect that it's ultimately what I
am...endless <italic>nothing </italic>(or <italic>everything</italic>
as Seamus pointed out)


This is the reason I watch T's films and read about is life, his
interests, his dilemmas and his decisions. His ability to move freely
through Bergman's "rooms" is rare. Yes, he was conditioned by his
setting, for better or worse, as we all are. He never forgot that and
it kept him and his work grounded. To me, knowing his social and
personal circumstances is vitally important to understanding how his
films are balanced. War, family, <italic>Homo Sovieticus</italic>...
all are unspoken constants in his films. 


But its no small point that these are <italic>films.</italic> And his
context in that regard tends, I think, to be more cross cultural. His
medium is the <italic>image</italic>, not the <italic>language</italic>
(that's why he would come up with apparently absurd ideas like filming
an almost silent version of <italic>Hamlet</italic> in John Ford
Valley!) There is, without a doubt, quite a lot of experience conveyed
through his films that I will never have access to due to the obvious
barriers. But for what ever reason there seems to be plenty of
inspiration accessible through <italic>other</italic> portals.


I'm respectfuly jealous that there is a kind of relationship to T that
you guys are born with, one that I will never know. Regardless how
close I feel to him I am not Russian and that's a reality I just don't
want to think about. I can cry and cry and do all I can to make light
of the fact but it remains that you, being Russian, have an
identification with him that is inimitable. 


But I think that I can make a bit of a case in defense of myself and
others, who aren't Russian. There is one aspect of T that outsiders
have that you guys will never be able to experience due to your
familiarity ...and that is a we see a more thorough
<italic>alterity</italic>. 


"Alterity" is strangeness, it's a word that suggests the psychological
stall or even awe that we feel when we encounter something so
different. There might be some fear in this encounter but no
zenophobia. The effect is a kind of beauty, the sublime. I'm thinking
that for us, as forigners, the simplest characteristics of mannerisms
and language in the every day incidentals in T's films -- even as they
are cultural limits -- can be seen as assets, and maybe yet
<italic>another</italic> aesthetic dimension in his films. T's so
natural with his scenes -- yes we can certainly feel that-- but to us
it's all imbued with an even greater strangeness. 


It's a sensability that is appropriate to T's methods, too. He was very
concerned with helping us all see our world with new sense of surprise.
I think this alterity is a considerable subject due to the point that
you made, Greg, that >Tarkovsky, first of all, was a great spiritual
leader and enlightener<<. His choice of sets, his placement and
movement of camera ... he did all kinds of things to increase this
sensation of peculiarity.  Being the kind of artist that he was, I
think he hoped this heightend sense of life's alterity would stay with
us as we left the film and that we might then notice in our own
normalcy something is renewed and unlike our habitual life.


Not to make too big of this alterity thing. I just thought it might
also express something to you about how his films can make such an
impression on us. Perhaps it's a small thing but hey, being overly
proud about small things is part of being a man! 


Anyway, Tarkovsky is the gift that keeps on giving, his multiplicity
has few peers that I have found in world cinema. Which brings me back
to the subject of eternity. But, as you may know, eternity is like a
wild animal. At the same time we hunt for it, eternity is stalking us.
So we move around it... it's too late to run ... to approach it
directly is impossible....  Perhaps because I'm older now I feel the
animal is closing in. I need some trust worthy advice on learning how
to live with it, you know? Tark is one of the few filmmakers I've found
who knows the problem.


So I'm interested in the discussions whether they be about Petric's
oneric style, esoteric gobbledegook or the latest Tarkovsky Laser Disc
and action figures. Some subjects have made me indignant (and
embarrased) in the past. My hope is that I am trying to stay focused on
an aesthetic that invokes a bit of ...you know what. 


I apologise for the leangth of this harangue, and thank you for
listening. Please participate more! I know the English can mean more
work for you guys but I really would like to encourage the exchange.
The artist in me respects the unutterable ---but also works for
understanding. Personlly I would love to read more from your
<italic>Russain </italic>perspective... and <italic>personal</italic>
perspective as well.


Finally (!), I also hope you are able to create a home for yourself
here in the U.S. without too much abrasion and loss.

How to eat a watermelon: carefully cut a hole in the side of the melon

After the bottle is drained, plug the piece of watermelon back into

Excellent point, Scott (I happen to know a Scott Rhodes here in LA and I'm
hoping like hell you're not him because the one I know is something of a
buffoon, albeit a nice guy).  My grandfather told me once that he had always
like Russians because they loved the same three things we Iranians hold most
dear:  tea, our families, and sadness.  The main objection I face when
proselytizing re: Tarkovsky (a practice I've pretty much given up on) is that
he's "too depressing" or that his films are "too sad".  This is something that
always pissed me off.  What kind of objection is that?  It took me a long time
to realize that many cultures don't prize a certain type of suffering the way
Iranian culture does.  It's seen either as a misery to be avoided or a price
to paid for attaining a higher wisdom.  

I've found Russian poetry similar in tone to Farsi and Arabic poetry in this
respect:  suffering is seen sometimes as a beautiful, immediate, forceful sign
that we are alive; and sometimes as a joyful end in itself.  This may sound
like a lot of crap but I'm afraid I can't think of a more coherent way of
explaining it.  Incidentally, for anybody who doesn't care for vodka (I feel
like a traitor!) rum works well also, though it blends better with fleshier
melons like cantaloupe.

Best wishes to all
Sarvenaz

Tarden, you replied to Scott:

Maybe you haven't experienced this, but something like it is available
under certain conditions. Things are as they are (tautologically
self-evident but unhelpful); but if I understand what this passage is
referring to, that state of being-in-itself (pure existence) can only be
experienced to the extent that we are unable to slot things into the
conceptual grids that our hierarchical processing structures overlay
(automatically, in ordinary consciousness) on raw perception.

What did Wallace Stevens say - No idea without the thing itself?
Unfortunately, if we have the idea, it tends to take over the thing itself.
If the idea (name, concept, use etc.) is no longer available, the thing
remains mysterious, potentially at least anything. Is an avocado still an
avocado if all you can say about it is that it is a fascinating oval-shaped
green object/event in a shifting sea of perception (not that I could say
that at the time either, out loud or to myself, but that was more or less
what I was able to think about it without using words). Was it at that
moment an avocado? Well no, not for me in any case. It had become a
thing-in-itself, self-sufficient and existing but not identifiable, not in
the ordinary sense the subject of thoughts about it, not one example bound
to a class of things/relationships...and certainly not an eternal Idea or
Ideal unless by that one means something other than the
blueprint-of-the-physical-manifestation concept, which is much more bound
up with language than the state I'm referring to here.

If one wishes to argue that such perceptions are the result only of a
temporarily deranged subjectivity and have no general significance, I would
simply offer what others have said many times before, that everything we
know is known subjectively in this way, and that, useful as it is, a
scientific consensus type of reality is only one of the inter-subjective
descriptions available to us.

The paradoxical thing about all this is that in order to experience/know
the unity underlying phenomena it seems one has to eradicate all "higher"
concepts and relationships and thus render oneself truly useless. I suspect
if God exists he doesn't know the meaning of avocados either, much less the
meaning of ground-of-being (but then do we know the meaning of these words
either? Only relatively speaking, by a process of eliminating what they
absolutely can't mean...)

If I may quote the whimsical and wistful Nick Drake on this and related
real-life dilemmas and confusions of meaning, relationship, consciousness,
identity, being and becoming, and other Big Concepts:

I could have been a sailor, could have been a cook
A real live lover, could have been a book
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle steady as a rock
I could be
Here and now
I would be I should be
But how?
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

I could have been your pillar, could have been your door
I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more
I could have been your statue
Could have been your friend
A whole long lifetime could have been the end
I could be yours so true
I would be, I should be through and through
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first.

I could have been a whistle, could have been a flute
A real live giver, could have been a boot
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock
I could be even here
I would be, I should be so near
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first.


Is anyone interested in talking about the relatively fixity or fluidity of
T's symbolism? Symbols can confound conceptual grids too, even if the only
way we can talk about that is (sigh) in conceptual grids (or in some kind
of meta-poetry).

I liked Mother and Son a great deal and disagree with every judgment made
here. So I'd be interested in hearing others' reactions to it. I wonder if
it should be measured against T though; certainly Sokurov has talked about
the differences in intent and approach, although like T's work it turns on
questions of faith and faithfulness. But Mother and Son is a two-character
work and narratively and conceptually it is very pared-down compared to
pretty much anything of T's; that doesn't make it superficial or cliched
however. Its images are exceptionally beautiful, as is its soundtrack. It's
almost a silent film in many ways, and is experienced more like visual art
and poetry than like most narrative cinema. Simply as an evocation of the
dying process it is unlike anything else I've seen.

As for Angelopoulos, prepare to be disappointed unless you go back to his
less sententious pre-90s work.

How about Gianni Amelio's Lamerica? I think there's a certain Tarkovskian
aura to its images and some of its incidents, even perhaps its narrative
trajectory, though some of its premises are very different.

I really appreciated this story, Scott. But consider also (as no doubt you
have) that internalized homophobia is something that gay people have to
struggle with daily. If your best friend couldn't tell you he was gay when
(presumably) it mattered, that was as much his problem as yours. Did he
ever discuss what it meant to him not to feel he could be exactly who he
was with you? What he was probably protecting was your sensitivity about
the subject (or his projection of that). And that may have had a profound
cost for him - or it may not have, depending on how he felt towards you.
And if he loved you he would also have been protecting himself from having
to deal with the anticipated rejection of those feelings (as he presumably
knew you were straight). And it may be that subconsciously you didn't trust
him enough on that score to make the subject even available to you to
possibly bring up with him (anyway the onus was always on him as the
different one, wasn't it?) And so, as you say, people protect each other in
a conspiracy of silence to save what they feel they have together from
possible conflict. It can be a deadly form of kindness. Under the
circumstances it *was* probably a kindness, but the circumstances are
anti-life. Privacy is a good thing insofar as it maximizes one's freedom
from others, but to the same degree it's very bad at maximizing one's
freedom with others.

To get back to Tarkovsky and Russia, it seems from what our Russian members
have said that men can be physical and even up to a point sensual with each
other as long as no homoeroticism is involved, but then the lavender
curtain comes crashing down so to speak - as it does say in any North
American locker room if someone glances the wrong way. But surely we should
throw out all these categories that help shore up the bad old concept of
masculinity, the one that can't stand without rejecting its feminine
shadow.

Obviously there's a continuum involving various degrees of bisexuality, not
necessarily acknowledged as such (and in an ideal world not having to be
acknowledged or identified as anything!). If Tarkovsky was bisexual - and
academic writers like Petrie are usually very conscious of how they phrase
anything to do with personal or sexual questions; if what they assert was
based only on speculation they would have said so - why should we protect
him from the charge rather than exploring how it might have played out in
his work and his life, including if possible asking people who knew him
what they think? It strikes me as not in the spirit of his work to place
limits on what can or should be said (apart from the usual limits of libel
and decency). Tarkovsky was not one to toe the social line...

Well, what would she have said? What would you say?

You better not go to Angelopulus.
Either you missed the whole point in Mother&Son or you will feel quite the
same in there...

<x-rich>Hey Seamus


Well I've written another long one... I'm terribly sorry ... hey did I
mention that I was glad your back?

<paraindent><param>right,left</param>

> I distinctly remember seeing one of the women from earlier in the
movie in the

>crowd at the end. I remember her only because she looks exactly like
the

>mother of an old friend. .... After all, unlike

>the city folk in Rome, the townspeople actually do run to help
Gorchakov.

</paraindent>

Is the woman mulling around in the mud the one you remember? Dark hair
... kind of resembles G's Russian wife....  As for the other, it's G's
driver who runs to G's aid, right? The people I'm refering to is
strictly the group gathered at the far end of the pool. 


But never mind all that now, I've just looked at it again and you are
right to balk at the idea of film set self-awareness thing. Funny how
memory serves-- I swear I can see a different shot in my mind, with
<italic>scores</italic> of people! Could someone have re-editied my LD
copy and replaced the shot with one of less people? 


I<italic> have</italic> dreamed I was watching unseen footage from T's
films before -- anyone else?


So even as they do easily pass for villagers and hotel patrons, I think
the substance of my point still holds ... I do feel there is a bit of a
jarring effect after watching G alone in that long take  and then
suddenly look up and see that people have been gathering and watching.
The intensity of the privacy is interupted ... and emphasised.

<paraindent><param>right,left</param>

</paraindent>

That sounds worth checking out, thanks for the referance, indeed. Its
bound to have some legitamacy in principle ... if we agree that Greek
theater began as Mystery rites. 



Well I might as well tell you those quotes were from Morrison, the
lizard kid -- they are from "The Lords". I bought it years ago and
shleved it. I picked it up a few months back for god knows why and read
a few pages and was mildly impressed. I read the whole thing and was
more impressed --then I read it again  (its less than 100 pages I
think) and noticed that he's actually weaving some pretty fundamental
and strong ideas together. That doesn't show from the little I posted.



One bit I liked was that he reversed the Oedepus act of withdrawing 
completely into the body by putting out his eyes when he says that the
body has become a "dry stalk to support these two soft insatiable
jewels":


<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param><smaller>There are no
longer "dancers," the possessed. The cleavage of men into actor and
spectators is the central fact of our time. We are obsessed with heroes
who live for us and whom we punish. If all the radios and televisions
were deprived of their sources of power, all books and paintings burned
tomorrow, all shows and cinemas closed, all the arts of vicarious
existence . . .


We are content with the "given" in sensation's quest. We have been
metamorphosised from a mad body dancing on hillsides to a pair of eyes
staring in the dark.


</smaller></paraindent><smaller>(Clearly we are great consumers .. but
do we consume most with our eyes?)

 

</smaller>Anyway This is the continuity he's building when proposes
such high faith in the priority of film, that it "runs on without any
eyes". I think it's a kind of poetic way to express our subordination,
being what I call<italic> fascist subjects</italic>.


<paraindent><param>right,left</param>><<<<Metamorphose. An object is
cut off from its name, habits, associations.

>Detached, it becomes only the thing, in and of itself. When this

>disintegration into pure existence is at last achieved, the object is

>free to become endlessly anything.>>

</paraindent>

I keep thinking he's talking about a<italic> metaphore</italic> here. 


Its funny that you and Tony both seem to have slightly different
subjective points of view here. If I understand correctly you are
<italic>observing</italic> the object, subjectively (hence its need to
be recognisable as something known to the observer) and Tony is
<italic>identifying </italic>with the object.


As I understand Morrison's messy mystical museings, I think he's
continuing his theme on the terrifying consequences of the spectator's
(voyeur's) potential for endless identifications. (I
<italic>think</italic>...)


<paraindent><param>right,left</param> The assumption here seems to be
that a thing is not in a

>state of pure existence if it is bound to labels, uses, etc. Pure
existence,

>it would seem to me, would be just such bindings and associations.
Being, by

>which I mean the state of being, is not the ability to become
"endlessly

>anything"--but the state of being SOMETHING, even several things.
Being

>anything is, ultimately, the same as being nothing--i.e. not existing
at all.


</paraindent>

I think you an Jim Mo agree about the potentiality of the object in
becoming a subject. Reminds me of Domenico's "Where am I when I am not
in my head?"

<paraindent><param>right,left</param>

> Influence is always a tricky issue--some

your

>connection of Mann's Death in Venice to Nostalghia some time ago (that
was

>you, wasn't it Scott?) is a good example of either subtle or
inadvertent

>influence. The presence of religious painting and orthodox ideas (such
as

>Thomas is one to point out) are usually blatant or subtle. The Milton

>connection seems to me at the very least unconscious, if not simply
the result

>of similar thinking (with, albeit a common basis.)

</paraindent>

To speak plainly, I think the characteristic of funneling into privacy
was not an act of borrowing, as you seem to be agreeing, it was due to
some common fundamental issues both men were dealing with. But who
knows, I'm sure Tark had<italic> heard </italic>of Mr. Milton....


In some ideal way I guess we would like all transmissions of culture
from one generation to the next to be unconchuss.( a cheap word, no?) 
But it doesn't matter much to me, I guess. We all surly agree that
culture gets passed on through our mental activities ... (we haven't
figured out how to grow math-skill pills on bushes yet.) It's easy to
see how some things are handed down, others ...not easy to see. They
seem to move, as you say, indirectly. Some ideas appear and dissapear
at the periphery of others, attached to them like they are...
symbiolic.


I think these is called <italic>Synchronic</italic> events.. opposed to
the <italic>diachronic</italic>... if I understand them. 


Anyway, isn't this kind of transmission of culture far more
interesting? More so than the cases where one guy READS another and
thinks "Oh yeah that's a good idea, I think I'll decide to write a book
kinda like that only different, cause I think that's a good idea that I
ought to rite about." 


Having said that ... I DO think that Death In V was on T's mind with
Nastolghia! Admitedly because at this point in my hermenutic it serves
me to think so. (You know how you need all the help you can get when
things are still forming?) But most of all because its does service to
the imagination to think so... which is a very important litmus test to
me. I'm not thinking of the type of dirivation that is anything like an
adaptation. It's inspiration, a dialogue that <italic>provokes
</italic>thought when the reference is made, and more so does not
<italic>end</italic>  even then. 


I may change my mind later when I get where I want to go with it but
for now I'm sticking to it.


The details are fine and evasive and often of course, just subjective
and personal. I'm not ready to show my hand , here. Such things take
time to properly rationalize! I thought I could get some thoughts
worked out during the discussion w/ Tony but I got doused while
splashing around in the <bold>shallow </bold>water of whether or not T
was bisexual. Guess I should just head on down to the deep end. For the
record, thats another thing... an impossible distinction (Bi/not Bi?). 
Who knows? I don't think he was an astronaut, either. These might be
methods for simply getting to another space. 


But then again maybe he faked his death and he's up there in the
spacestation MIR with Jim Morrison having cocktails singing "We all
live in a Yellow Submarine".

<x-rich>Does anyone know where the opening sequence of Rublev was filmed? 


http://www.novsu.ac.ru/novgorod/architecture/english/arc_22.html


The St George Cathedral in Novgorod looks very similar to it - even the
lake in the background looks familiar - but its hard to tell from the
small image. 


One of the most famous Icons of St. George (maybe <italic>the</italic>
most famous) was painted at this monestary, if I'm not mistaken. 


Has anyone else noticed St. George as a recurring motif in Rublev?

hi, new to the list - not sure if those beautifully-packaged Tarkovsky
soundtracks on cd have already been discussed.  well, there's 4 volumes,
and if you're not in japan, they'll probably cost you 30 bucks each.  off
of some japanese label.  has anyone heard these yet?   impressions?

thanks, eric.

That's plausible. But he also seems to be saying something else. I haven't
read The Lords, but he seems to be suggesting that as a 20th century rite
cinema has some existence and even function when it's not being paid
attention to and thus not making us into voyeurs. Perhaps somehow a
parallel with those performances for the gods that take place on certain
busy yet ritually significant Bangkok street corners, and that no human
(apart from the performers) need even notice, but that are necessary to
keep things in balance. On the other hand this doesn't really make any
sense: cinema is already absence/history, detached from the body - a
one-way, basically non-participatory medium for spirit voyages, and fixed,
a foregone conclusion without the possibility of deviation or present acts
of subversion; for it also not to be seen is to render it a mere piece of
machinery, one soon on the way to the junkheap. And if Morrison is talking
from the point of view of the filmmaker rather than the audience, how would
he reconcile these comments with The Doors' performances? Taking the
audience-beast with him to some place way beyond safety and decorum was the
whole point, wasn't it? Cinema just can't do that nearly as directly; what
kind of cinema really "returns us to anima, religion of matter"? (Maybe I'm
being too literal here. Maybe part of his point is that cinema impacts
powerfully on the body but is also light, immaterial, and therefore can
bring together many materialities and metaphors in a short time, unlike the
theatre, which is bounded by a particalar space.)

But metaphors, slippery as they are, still cannot be endlessly anything.
Pure existence is meaningless, metaphors are meaningful only to the extent
that they create some intersecting semantic nets that we hadn't considered
before. Metaphors are never things in and of themselves, they're always
several or many things at once, beyond singularity. (Would Barthes
disagree?) Again, maybe I'm totally missing the point.

I thought he was celebrating it. If we identify with something we are no
longer detached, there is the possibility of becoming what we experience
rather than merely thinking about it:

>Strange, fertile correspondences the alchemists sensed in unlikely orders

Yeah, metamorphosis. You still have to see the images though for it to
happen. But certainly a radical cinema of transformation is what he's
talking about. I just don't think he's being very consistent in how he
talks about it.

I think what he's envisioning breaks down narrative far more than Tarkovsky
ever did. Morrison seems to be suggesting a poetic politics of cinema (this
was around '68 after all) but one equally far removed from the
intellectualism of a Godard and the socially uncommitted formalism of much
of the New American Cinema (though maybe there's a connection with Anger,
Jacobs, Pat O'Neill...). Yet one feels he would at least have admired
Tarkovsky for his "shining juxtapositions".

<x-rich>Hey Tony


Wish I had more time to clarify these fascinating issues. I'm leaving
town for a few days and I'm trying to get some thoughts down before I
forget the thread. I hope I havn't botched the subject up too badly.


Your letter was very good. Forcing me to think more decidedly from a
perspective uncommon to my daily one. I appreciate that greatly.

<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>

</paraindent>

The generalazations have caught up with me... I know I'm probably more
guilty than most though. Anyway, you'll have to take my word on this I
can't imagine that Carl and I could have been closer friends no matter
how much sex we could have had. Sometimes the limits and tensions serve
us in their own ways don't you think?  Life being a big wad of psychic
surprises. Life without suffering is the most reprehensible form of
death. In my absurd opinion. Of course ideally we should be allowed to
chose our suffering, but I'm not mature enough for that.


<italic>Nastolghia</italic>, for me, is the ultimate failure of<italic>
all</italic> our relationships, even through the best of our multi
faceted modes of identification. From cultural heritage down to an
identification with the sex drive. Gorchakov seems to have found an
alienation that reminds me of Maimonodes' negative theology: He know
longer knows who he is, but he knows who he is not. Gorchakov seems to
be to be unsatisfied with them all --- even as he feels the agonizing
loss of the kind of soul they provided.


I say this because I don't think we will ever create a social arena
that's for everybody... though we personally can  never give up
trying.

<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>

 Privacy is a good thing insofar as it maximizes one's freedom

</paraindent>


This is a well put thought, private identity is something I feel is
really deep trouble in media filled countries like this one. As a
matter of fact I can't say what it is. I have the feeling you are
talking about secrets, though. If so I'm with you 100%

<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>

</paraindent>Another well put thought, as you go on to say there's a
continuum to our identity that is difficult enough to access as it is. 
But, careful with that Junging schtick, you might hurt somebody. Not
because I disagree but because its so much easier said than done! I'm
not one to encourage such naive notions as "getting in touch with your
shadow side" maybe I'm the psycho but some of my shadows are folks I
don't want anywhere near my kids or anyone elses. I toss em a bone and
a beer every now and then to keep them from starving to death and
taking me with them but otherwise I'm scared pretty much stupid by most
of them. The female one's you seem to be referring to don't bother me
as much, though. Except one <italic>Lilith the Lesbian</italic> she
gives me LOTS of trouble. I did appear in a film in drag once. (don't
go trying to rent it... sorry)

</paraindent>Well I'm not quite fresh on the subject right now so I'll
just whiz through some of my impressions.


I think Fascism is a specific historical circumstance. I don't agree
that it's a phenomenon with symptoms. Hitler was an artist. I'll give
him that. He may be the greatest artist of the twentieth century even.
(Artist: NOT synonymous with "good")


There are aesthetics of power, beauties that energize us. But the
closer we get to the nerve the more we need insulation, and some kind
of method of retreval.  


Those areas of mystical sources don't always come with instructions.
Nothing wrong with power per se.. there's good and bad. But even those
distinctions are illegible. The powers we invite or ingest keep us
vital and viable. They can also be deadly destructive and so we need
equally powerful containers. Which are composed of equally destructive
energies. ("When I hear the word culture I pull my gun")  


So yes those aesthetics can be dangerous, though I wouldn't say
Goebbles or Riefenstahl are any more central representatives than
Christianity or MTV. Calling all formal compositions with mystic
dimensions "Fascist tendencies" is no help at all. I think they can
also be called "Romantic".


Thanks for the reference to Gianni Amelio. I'm completely ignorant
until I read this.

  Based on the surviving footage, some people believe that "Que viva México"
had the potential of being Eisenstein's greatest film.  ...we will never know.

Some additional backstory [all info culled from David A. Cook's "A History of
Narrative Film" (New York, 1981)]:

1) 1930 Eisenstein signs a contract with the Mexican Film Trust, a corporation
made up of the American novelist Upton Sinclair and other investors, to make a
film in Mexico.
2) Eisenstein later writes that the film was to have been "four novels framed
by prologue and epilogue, unified in conception and spirit, creating its
entity."
3)1932 Sinclair orders that further filming be abandoned, and correctly
accuses Eisenstein of far exceeding his budget.
4) Sinclair reneges on his promise of sending the negative to Moscow for
Eisenstein to edit and finish, and instead sells the footage to the
independent producer Sol Lesser.
5) Lesser cuts part of one episode into a silent melodrama of revenge titled
"Thunder Over Mexico" (1933), and parts of the epilogue into another titled
"Death Day" (1934).  Both films are critical and commercial failures.
6) Remaining footage find their way into various documentaries on the making
of "Que viva México!", and ultimately into the archives of the Museum of
Modern Art in New York.

  Based on the surviving footage, some people believe that "Que viva México"
had the potential of being Eisenstein's greatest film.  ...we will never know.
     
Some additional backstory [all info culled from David A. Cook's "A History of 
Narrative Film" (New York, 1981)]:
     
1) 1930 Eisenstein signs a contract with the Mexican Film Trust, a corporation 
made up of the American novelist Upton Sinclair and other investors, to make a 
film in Mexico.
2) Eisenstein later writes that the film was to have been "four novels framed 
by prologue and epilogue, unified in conception and spirit, creating its 
entity."
3)1932 Sinclair orders that further filming be abandoned, and correctly 
accuses Eisenstein of far exceeding his budget.
4) Sinclair reneges on his promise of sending the negative to Moscow for 
Eisenstein to edit and finish, and instead sells the footage to the 
independent producer Sol Lesser.
5) Lesser cuts part of one episode into a silent melodrama of revenge titled 
"Thunder Over Mexico" (1933), and parts of the epilogue into another titled 
"Death Day" (1934).  Both films are critical and commercial failures.
6) Remaining footage find their way into various documentaries on the making 
of "Que viva México!", and ultimately into the archives of the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York.

México!'" (Bloomington, Ind., 1971)

<x-rich>Hey folks


Speaking of Esienstein, I recently read somewhere that he thought his
editing juxtapositions were analogous to the inner monologue of Joyce's
<italic>Ulysses</italic>.


I wonder if Esienstein was discovering in cinema the effects of what we
now call the <italic>auteur</italic> -- maybe he was seeing the
directors "vision"  (voice) is apparent as the <italic>willed</italic>
montage?

joyce knew of eisenstein's work and thought that the russian director was
the only one in the world capable of making a film version of ulysses.
tarkovsky, in my opinion, is another candidate.

I saw a good movie with references to Andrei.  Its a Scottish film called
"Regeneration."

BTW, I am new to this group - what is the opinion of this august body to
Oliver Stone's attempts at Tarkovskyism?  I can see him reaching in his
films, but to me its just not quite there...

perhaps stone was trying in natural born killers, but he's not quite there
yet.  he's enormously ambitious, but lacking in intellect--a much inferior
director.

I'm sorry but, in  my opinion, I'd have to say Oliver Stone has almost nothing
in common with Tarkovsky, his whole being is almost the antithesis of what
Tarkovsky stood for.

However, I feel there are two popular directors who have at times picked up
the Tarkovsky mantle:
Vincent Ward (see his first film Vigil, also Navigator and Map of the Human
Heart) 
and
Lars Von Trier (especially Element of Crime, but also Breaking the Waves and
the Kingdom)

Hallelujah.  That guy gets on my last nerve.  Not that there isn't a certain
stultifying pleasure in his stuff, but it's a low-rent pleasure.  Lars von
Trier I like.  Anybody else have other pet films or directors?  They needn't
be "difficult".  I volunteer "Forbbiden Games" (Jeux entendu, I think, in the
orig. French.)

Have you seen "The Idiots"(1997)  by Lars von Trier? Nothing to do with
Tarkovsky but still worth seeing.

Has anyone seen the film of Ulysses? UK version from mid sixties. I think
directed by Joseph, or Joe Strick (?).

It was clever, but I think only in reference to the book rather than as a
film on its own. 

Sometimes, what is latent in a novel needs to be spelled out in film and
vice versa.

Yeah, I just read about this in David Lodge's "The Art of Fiction", an
otherwise deathly boring book.  Interestingly, Joyce himself thought
Eisenstein would be the only man good for the job.

Yes, I saw it in a class once and then again on my own. Pretty bad, though
there were some clever moments, I agree. More than anything I thought it just
dated badly. It seemed like an old episode of the Avengers or something.
Strick isn't much of a director. I think, too, that there is a mistaken
attempt on the part of people filming Joyce to become artsy--Joyce was a
realist in the most ambitious sense of the word. All of his experiments were
aimed at portraying reality more effectively.

It'll take place in the cinema Muranow. I don't know the details of the
program, but   the organizer, Roman Gutek from Gutek-Film told that will be
shown his last works :"Idioterne" and "Breaking the waves",
and both parts of the "Kingdom". I heard that von Trier is making now the
third part. Does anybody know something about it?

Does anybody have any information on where I can find a copy of the CD
"Hommage a Andrei Tarkovsky" (Deutsche Grammophon: 437 840-2) in the US
or through mail order?  I am aware of two recordings of a composition by
Takemitsu (he wrote the music to "Ran" and "Woman of the Dunes"; also,
he greatly admired Tarkovsky's sound design) titled NOSTALGHIA written
in honor of Tarkovsky, but I am unable to find the above compilation
CD.  I believe I read somewhere that "Hommage a Andrei Tarkovsky" was
conducted by Claudio Abbado, but I have no information on the list of
composers.  Any help?  Thanks.

Arvo Part, the Estonian composer has a CD dedicated to Tarkovsky. It's
one of the ones on ECM ... Arbos or Misere or Tabula Rasa, I'm not sure
which. Dead good though. Tintinabullation rules

Hi there:

      There's also another album that's 'Dedicated to Andrei Tarkovsky'

      It's called 'La Nouvelle Serenite',featuring Jon Hassell,Harold Budd,and Gavin Bryars.

      It's released by a Belgium label called 'Subrosa',in their 'Myth' series.

      This album is good,it has that 'Tarkovsky Atmosphere',I think.

i'm new to this tarkovsky group, and though i've seen all the films i
can't say i'm at all familiar w/ his work. what got me started was andrei
rublev, which i thought was probably the most beautiful film i've ever
seen. it still remains my favorite. his later work i didn't like as
much--the sacrifice, especially, i thought poor.  does anyone else here
hold that opinion as well?

The general breakdown as regards opinions of Tarkovsky's work that I've seen
is this: half the viewers seem to prefer his earlier work (through Solaris),
less than half (but a more vocal bunch) prefer his later work but appreciate
his earlier work. And then a small amount like both more or less equally.

I fall into the second category: Rublev, Solaris, Ivan--all seem to me
interesting and at times brilliant. But it is Nostalghia and The Sacrifice
that keep me obsessed. Stalker and Mirror are in at a close second. The later
works seem more mature to me, more developed, and more focused--more poetic.
The earlier works seem to be exploring  ideas, but in a less developed and
less focused way.

Mind you: I feel that all of his films are exceptional--but I tend to see his
films as becoming more mature over time. This is not an especially thorough
argument on my part--but it should help get the ball rolling.

Interesting, just like a band.  There are people who practically resent those
who came to Tarkovsky "backwards" (later work first) or once he got to be
"popular".  The difference with Tarkovsky is that his work did not become more
"commercial" (unless color is in and of itself commercial) or worse yet become
simply stupid (eg David Lynch).  Tarkovsky as rock star:  I shudder to think.

i confess i've only seen the film once, and am not offering my opinion
seriously. but perhaps you may enlighten me as to what there is to get,
though i understand that films are not meant to be explained verbally. 
my initial impression was that tarkovsky was trying to do a lot, perhaps
too much, in his last work, and failed to achieve anything. and i
generally don't think that a complex symbolic design alone would make a
great work of art.

 Yes. I agree with you on this. I know that i am in the minority, but
I personally feel that Nostaghia was it: His penultimate work
(remember, after all how it ends). 
Logically, there was no where for him to go after that. Excpet of
course to purgatory.

Aestheticly, the Sacrifice holds no surprises; little of the intuitive
geniuse of his better works. His manipulation of space and time is
reduced to pat formulars (45 min 'chunks', or cycles. = to the
biorythmic patterns of perceptual activity). because of this there is
a particular kind of ridgedness present. The 'padding out' that T.
utilizes habitually in his works is strained. The reduncies faulters
on occation and slips into catatonia. The self-reflexivity reduced to
a shallow expedienfcy. It fails to reach the sublime (taking the
moment beyond the artifice) hight of the baths sequences that
finalises Nostalgia.

With all of his precarious circumstances, T. was a desperate filmaker.
Perhaps he wrote himself out to early. The fact remains though, in the
end, that he was a walking deadman, and he knew it to. 
If there is anything to salviged from the  Sacrifice it can only be
gained from understanding the film this way. Tarkovsky faced the
ultimate nightmare of the artist: the irrovokable knowelled that his
best work was behind him, and this is a terrible fate for somebody who
entreanched thier life so much in their art. 

I suspect that there is a cautionary tale somewhare in their for all
of us...

</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;

<P>It is always so easy to became involved with a stranger who is a public
person and too identified with that person to the point you think you have
some authority over his work or the way he thinks.... 'Experts' who gain
a persona and an existence by merely being the shadow of another person...
Literary critics, music experts, barren academics... well, it seems not
only rock stars get this kind of treatment by their fun clubs and groupies
but also 'intellectuals' that admire the 'difficult' work of Tarkovsky
etc. fall into the trap... because simply education is not enough to have
some marrow inside..... the faces change but the story is the same....

<P>And again this reference to David Lynch; is he really the most intellectual
director the west can show for itself now as an 'answer' to Tarkovsky?
I've seen the 'Lost Highway' and I admit that I regretted not renting a
porno movie, at least i'd got the real stuff there .....&nbsp; David is
the one of best tv directors, but that's as far as he can get... Maybe
if he studied a bit and prayed, maybe he could produce some substantial
work; but now he's the best the Mc Donald's culture can offer... and that's
not enough for my soul really...

<P>So, this is over and done with? So, Andrei is dead and we have to wait
for another (rock) star to bright up our skies?&nbsp; So this time is gone
for ever and we stand facing the 2000 without anything to inspire us ,
to get the motor running and to make us alive , like good rock music does
(sorry, DID) ? ....Yes, hard as it is, personally I HAVEN'T' SEEN LATELY
anything uplifting.&nbsp; And this is the plain truth, cut and dried.

<P>So when you say 'watch the film for a year and then you get it' isn't
that a groupie approach to Tarkovsky? I think it is.....

<P>So like a game which band or rock star do you think would be comparable
to Andrei? .....remember the game of chinese portraits? .....if he was
a flower, what flower he would be? ....

<P>ps. so color is 'commercial'? ..... great , now we get the puritan attitude
around here!!!! .....&nbsp; and Tarkovsky is an orthodox christian.....&nbsp;
what else???&nbsp; ...he is the sheep enduring the sacrifice to save this
soulless world.....&nbsp; he raises upon his shoulders the weight of the
world......&nbsp; he is the 'clean' artist who made it into commerciality????&nbsp;
What is this commerciality really? Achieve the status of Von Spielberg
? No, this is ANOTHER kind of commerciality....

<P>.....ok, perhaps I dig Tarkovsky because he did no favors to anyone.....&nbsp;
not even to his 'fans'....&nbsp; so he is the bad boy..... and the genuine
rock star because he had lots of ATTITUDE and guts to be just himself....
SHAMELESS !!!!!

Aphrodite, darling!
Is the summer over yet?

It's so good to see you here again. And so wonderful to have your 
sharply defined opinions. Still, Tarkovsky emerged as a real great 
artist emerges, sparringly and only once in a great while, like 
Johan-Sebastian Bach, whose music he himself greatly admired. For almost 
15 years I, personally feel that cinema as art is going trough its major 
crisis. The great ones are gone, or doing no more. We will have to wait 
a little more and see what hides beyond 2000. There will be no more 
Andrei, but look at one wonderful elder who is still with us - 
Michelangelo Antonioni. You might say his last effort was no good, you 
might like it, but nobody with sane mind will deny, that he is evolving. 
So is the cinema.

Alex

Hi
I've just subscribed to the list and people are shouting at each other...
mmmm... at least its alive.

strangely major arguments are evolving aroung things such as nacionality
and age, wich does't seem to be relevant at all, at least as far as film
value
is concerned...

Anyway, I haven't seen any of Tarkovski's films on the screen, but I have
some
on tape, like Mirror, Stalker (I read the book wich is very much different
from the movie), Ivans Childwood, Solaris and Sacrifice.

How is your expirience with his movies?
I ask because it must be a completley different experience to see them on
the big screen.

Is anyone familiar with the works of Sharunas Bartas or Manoel de Oliveira?

<< , it seems not only rock stars get this kind of
 treatment by their fun clubs and groupies but also 'intellectuals' that
admire the
 'difficult' work of Tarkovsky etc. fall into the trap... because simply
education
 is not enough to have some marrow inside..... >>

I admit it, I'm a shameless groupie.  Also an intellectual, by default, the
things I like are the things intellectuals flock toward, though I own very
little black clothing and have no opinion whatsoever on Kierkegaard...  I'm
not sure about the education remark -- what kinds of assumptions can you
safely make?  As it happens I barely graduated from highschool and flunked out
of college almost instantly, but I assure you that no school would knock the
marrow out of me.

<< And again this reference to David Lynch; is he really the most intellectual
 director the west can show for itself now as an 'answer' to Tarkovsky? >>

Who ever claimed Lynch was an intellectual?  He's the great glorifier of the
small world and small ambitions of the anti-intellectual middle class, wholly
white, suburban, and frenziedly neurotic.  No point comparing him to
Tarkovsky, their work is utterly unrelated, it's like comparing William Blake
and Dennis Cooper.  But hey, sometimes I feel like being frenzied.
 
<< So like a game which band or rock star do you think would be comparable to
Andrei?>>

Tony always brings up Nick Drake, which makes sense:  his music is beautiful,
painful, spirtual, hopeful, and sometimes depressing if that's the way you
want to take it.

 <<ps. so color is 'commercial'? ..... great , now we get the puritan attitude
around
 here!!!! >>

Man, did you even read what I wrote??  Was I being cryptic or something?

Hey Henry,

First of all, I apologize for being snotty.  Your criticisms of "The
Sacrifice" are quite legitimate.  Actually, I found it pretty stupefying
myself, the first time.  I was crying by the end but I didn't know why.  When
I advised you to just keep watching once a year I really meant more than
anything that I can explain what a symbol might mean, but that this won't
carry any emotional weight for you until something has happened in your life
which will bring the message home.  I only really felt as though I'd begun to
understand this film after nursing a close friend through the last several
months of his struggle with cancer.  Watching him lose everything, even his
physical body, to disease and still keep his smile, still keep his faith, was
an indescribable experience for me.  Afterward, I saw "The Sacrifice" again
and cried again.  I still can't really articulate why but I believe that I
understand it, even if I can't communicate it to you.

Welcome to the discussion group--the shouting is atypical. And be sure to read
over what Aphrodite has to say more carefully, don't let the tone fool you.
She has a lot to say.

Seeing Tarkovsky on the big screen is essential. I won't go so far as many
might and say that you haven't seen his work until you've seen it on the big
screen--that's bullshit--but it definitely adds layers. Most noticeably: the
change is film stocks becomes far more noticeable, and the textures far more
varied. This is especially true of his last four films where the use of
sepiatone and other monochromatic film stocks is so prevalent. Stalker, for
instance, has a rusty hue on the big screen which gradually settles into sepia
and then into a washed out color. Much of that subtlety is lost on video.
Also: the long-takes show their success in larger venues when your eyes can
roam about and look at the complexity of the filmed world just like they would
in the real world--no shitty cuts and close-ups to tell you what to look at.
Plus there's just the usual advantages of seeing things as they were designed
to be seen, etc.

Aphrodite:

Good to hear your voice--well, you know what I mean. Your attack (ah, it takes
me back to hear you shrieking like that again--back to when this list was
really prime time) happened to include a quotation of my email, as quoted by
someone else. I hope, then, that my breakdown wasn't wrongfully associated
with the attitude you were attacking.

As per the rock star comment--it sounded to me like it was more of a passing
joke about the way fandom breaks things down. Either way, I wasn't speaking in
my original post of attitudes of fans towards other fans--just of certain
types of fans to certain films by Tarkovsky.

Still, whatever it takes to get you back in the mix Aphro. Whatever it takes!

Seamus

 First off--you are absolutely correct in calling Nostalghia Tark's
 "penultimate work"--it was. Especially since penultimate means, simply, "next
 to last." Still, I also tend to see it as his greatest film. Nonetheless, I
 disagree with your statement that he had nowhere left to go from Nost.--his
 next film, in this sense, is the logical conclusion of Nostalghia.
 
 Nostalghia, as I have argued at length in the past, is a concerned with women
 and motherhood. The film begins with a visiting to the painting of the Virgin
 Mother, a Catholic litany on the attributes Mary (mother of this mother of
 that . . .), a sexton's lecture on the place of women in society, a narrator
 who longs for his wife and children, a dream sequence that shows his pregnant
 wife on a bed outlined dimly against the infinite darkness of space (she
seems
 to be floating--the eternal mother), countless images of babies (including
 that darkly hideous painting in Domenico's home).   It is no surprise then to
 find that the film is dedicated to the memory of Tarkovsky's mother--I will
 not take the time to interpret the film, simply to point out a thematic
 preoccupation.
 
 The Sacrifice: this film is similar to Nostalghia and is, I would argue, a
 continuance of the ideas in Nostalghia--except that here it is the Father/son
 relationships that dominates. Little Man and Alexander, the metaphor of the
 tree, the sacrifice of the father for the son--the film is dedicated by Tark
 to his own son. The films are inextricably interwoven--rhapsodies on an
 infinite theme. Look at other similarities: both films feature purging by
fire
 (sacrifice), both contain holy fools, both contain miniatures (in Sacrifice
of
 the house--as made by little man, in Nost of the valley in Domenico's home). 
 
 Does this repetition indicate that Tarkovsky was all out of things to say? I
 think not. In the Sacrifice we see a stunning meditation on the difficulty of
 passing on the wisdom one has attained in one's life--the impossibility of
 completely transferring what one has learned to the next generation. Little
 Man has retained the ritual his father introduced to him of watering the
 tree--but the films ends with his echoing one of the first things his father
 says at the beginning of the film, in the form of a question: " 'In the
 beginning was the word' why is that Papa?" But Alexander has renounced
 speech--as we all must some day.
 
 To me The Sacrifice is a fitting close to a splendid career. True, I think
 Nostalghia was the pinnacle of that career--but The Sacrifice is among his
 strongest films--technically and ideologically.

If only I had a place around me that would show Tarks( or any good stuff 
for that matter) stuff without having to travel thousands of miles and 
stuff. I mean there is this one place about an hour away that I can see 
some stuff (just saw Henry Fool etc..) but damn I wish I could see Tarks 
films on the big screen.
No point, just whining.

But consider that Little Man is about 7...whereas T's own sons were about
23 (Arseny) and 14 (Andrei) when The Sacrifice was made (although younger
when the script took shape in the early 80s). So if this was T's thematic
intention it seems he stacked the cards against success by having the kid
be so young, though according to Andrei the relationship *is* modelled on
theirs.

As Sarvenaz suggests, the end of the film is nevertheless very very moving.
Little Man speaks, somehow a small "miracle" has occured (even though it
perhaps was likely to happen/did happen anyway naturally, as we don't know
that Little Man was unable to speak before his operation, his mute
condition may have been temporary), and what he says brings the film and
life full circle. What is affirming is that he got the main point, and that
he asks the question even if there is no one to answer. (And there never
really is anyone or Anyone to answer even in T's world, we all have to make
up our own answers, as Alexander himself does I think through his
sacrifice. Although this may seem a very agnostic and subjective position
given some of T's own statements about The Sacrifice, I feel the film
supports it through the obvious negative as well as positive effects of
Alexander's actions, the ambiguous dreamscape in which the sacrifice is
conceived and undertaken (or merely imagined), and the impossibility of
confirmation that it was answered. As in Roublev, Solaris, Stalker and
Nostalghia, we are faced with a mystery, and the characters' faith(fulness)
is as much a humanistic, intensely personal response as a religious one.
One difference, in the later films faith is depicted as more deranged: it
seems the more T felt the need to make a positive statement, the harder it
was for him to show it simply and uncomplicatedly. Despite himself he never
became an ideologue.

To get back to Little Man and the question of transmission, in a way what
more can one ask for? Intellectual knowledge as well as personal
reflections, beliefs  and attitudes can be transmitted with some accuracy
and success down the generations through the written word, but as a
dramatic filmmaker and as a person T is engaged by the word made flesh, the
living example (unlike his supposed hero Bresson, who in my opinion dealt
more and more with abstractions; he even forced his actors not to be human,
which T could never do). Little Man's question is in fact the Word (latent
form or pattern, what underlies all thought and action, what endures,
however one sees it) being made flesh one more time, the very first
utterance (again) after a long period of gestation, the dead tree and the
boy growing "back" into life. Its purity and simplicity, like Little Man's
quiet, reflective demeanor and the highly formal ecstasy of Bach's music,
is so poignant by contrast with the crazed confusions and terrible
conflicts involved in Alexander's vow to save the world for his son.

For some reason it has always seemed to me that the cut from the fire scene
to this one hides a gap in time, that this scene could be days or months
later, marking a kind of return, a coming back together from that former
time: Maria by chance passing on her bicycle, the ambulance now returning
Alexander to his family...I know this doesn't really make sense and must
represent some kind of wish fulfillment on my part, but then the supposed
time continuity from the previous shot doesn't seem to make filmic sense
either (in particular isn't the ambulance going in the other direction, at
least in terms of screen direction if not "real" direction?). Since T has
compressed time emblematically into the fire scene's self-contained
plan-sequence (there was no one to call the ambulance after all...), the
final shots feel like an epilogue.

Your response to my defense of The Sacrifice reads like an elaboration of my
argument, not a refutation of it. The end of the film is certainly an epilogue
and was probably intended as such.

I don't see where the age of Little Man in any way undermines the thematic
occupation of the film--I didn't say that the film was autobiographical,
simply that it was dedicated to his son. How does one pass on knowledge? An
older son would have complicated the relationship he was trying to portray--an
older son would have meant another type of movie (and maybe a very good
one)--something like the father/ son relationship in Mirror.

If The Sacrifice has a flaw it is the flaw that is inherent in all parables--a
reduction of complexity into simplistic categories. But that is also its
strength: simplicity. You argue that Tarkovsky was unable, despite himself, to
make simple statements about faith--this is not something to complain about.
Faith isn't simple--consider the story of the garden that Alexander tells
Maria. Simplicity is spoiled by tampering and structuring. So it is with the
Sacrifice: the message is at once simple in form (a parable) and incredibly
complex.

Much has been made of the fact that no one could have called the
ambulance--and, if one likes, it can be conceded that Tark nodded off here.
Honestly, I've never really cared much. It's like complaining about the
talking wolf in the story of Little Red Riding Hood--if you get hung up on
that you miss the point of the parable. Given the choice between continuity
and beauty, I'll take beauty.

Which is one of the things I like best about his films.  They are very much
like Bach, whose music, perhaps because of and perhaps in spite of the
formality (which yields the sort of intricacy of pattern and symbol which
intellectuals and groupies alike adore working through) they are primarily
ECSTATIC.  I often think that talking or writing about these films is
pointless if not actually harmful in some way. 

By the way, Seamus, do you have a crush on Aphrodite?  That's very charming.

I also know another Tarkovsky CD.It has been prepared by famous conductor
Claudio Abbado.He requested  a piece from four contemporary composers.
I can remember two names ;Luigi Nano and  György Kurtag.And this
compositions have been played in a festival and recorded by Deutche
Gramaphone .It is really nice.Both Tarkovsky and modern classical music
fans can be interested in.I can later give the number of the  CD

hi Seamus,

I really want to comment 2 things you have said :

a)

>  Nostalghia, as I have argued at length in the past, is concerned with women
>  and motherhood. The film begins with a visiting to the painting of the Virgin
>  Mother, a Catholic litany on the attributes Mary (mother of this mother of
>  that . . .), a sexton's lecture on the place of women in society, a narrator
>  who longs for his wife and children, a dream sequence that shows his pregnant
>  wife on a bed outlined dimly against the infinite darkness of space (she
> seemsto be floating--the eternal mother), countless images of babies (including
>  that darkly hideous painting in Domenico's home).   It is no surprise then to
>  find that the film is dedicated to the memory of Tarkovsky's mother--

.....apart of these obvious facts, one has to consider the more or less enigmatic
figure of Domenico. Who is really Domenico? The easy answer would be a 'holy
fool'; if so,  how does he fits in the pattern of 'motherhood' you have suggested
here? Because I cannot really understand the connection between the two themes....

And one more thing : at the dream sequence, we also see the girlfriend-
interpreter exchanging secrets with the mother.... we never hear , perhaps the
protagonist too, what the two women are really saying! This is also a strong and
somehow difficult to understand scene.... The Mother is passing secrets about the
son to the Woman? Is this a female conspiracy, or an attempt from his mother's
side to protect him by letting her know his sui generis nature?

But in Nostaghia the woman is never a woman really because a. she has voluntarily
renounced her child baring rights (she is beautiful and typically desirable but it
is clear that she is such not to facilitate nature but to achieve her own
egotistical means, she lacks the inner devotion to nature/God/man) b. she remains
a 'virgin' to the protagonist/poet...  So the whole presentation of motherhood is
alien to real life; it is only an image in a church, a dream, a remembrance, a
nostalgic longing for the Woman ; In reality the woman is not an object of desire,
intercourse is denied, pregnancy avoided, and the 'meeting' of man and woman
produces only sterility and frustration.... a fertile ground for dreams, memory
and past to be revisited. I can think a few things here but it would be too easy
in this point for me to blame once again A.Tarkovsky for not being able to adapt
to the woman's rights movement...  Even if it is so, I don't think he is alone
there! And maybe by achieving one good cause , woman has lost track of the meaning
of 'sacrifice' - essential to motherhood in a way... Negative, difficult feelings
thrive in his last 2 films... A reversed world order, perhaps.

b) you say.....

>  In the Sacrifice we see a stunning meditation on the difficulty of

Perhaps Alexander has renounced speech.... because he represents God, the Father,
in his celestial version but also the God inside every human being. We have heard
so many times of the 'Silent God' of our times who stays speechless in front of
the situation his creature created; the silent , meditative God that is no longer
the Action God for reasons perhaps beyond His own volition. So the child here
perhaps embodies the New type of God, the one that is to emerge out of the dead
ends his father's dominion has created. No one is to blame, and everybody has paid
his own debts; but the old must go and the new is  so young that it still needs
nurturing and time to develop. The outcome is yet uncertain.....  But how one can
describe all these feelings/thoughts without falling into the most dreaded
situation of offending God? Perhaps the only way to talk about God, to start a
dialogue with Him is to be cryptical, not in an attempt to confuse your fellow
humans but to show the appropriate respect to Him... The Son still immature but
innocent, with a spontaneous wisdom, re-examines the basics his father handed down
to him; the function of the mind, and his material manifestation: speech,
language. He still waters the dead tree in a scene that evokes japanese landscapes
and rituals. But we all see it through the eyes of the departing God; the lonely,
archetypal, leader who's grown desperate and dysfunctional, uncomfortable with his
own achievements... self-destructive even...

it's funny really : like an old rock star...

a.

<x-rich>Friends and lovers:


Something that troubles me is: what is involved with the covert malice
that Alexander has toward his son? 


Alexander's slow growing self awareness seems to be a slow progression
in his life. ("A man who is developing a conscience" is  T's
description of the off screen father in <italic>Mirror)</italic> 
Alexander quits the theater because of his sudden (perhaps belated)
discovery of the dishonesty of "acting". His imperceptive speculation
about why he quit theater led him to conceed that it was "possibly" due
to some kind of spite toward Adelaid (She loved him because he was an
actor so he quit). 


I cannot escape that the connection between "acting" in the sense of
entertainment is related to the problem of action in Nostalghia -- as
Seamus says there is a continuity between the two films. "words ,
words, words ...If only I could DO something."  Hamlet's preoccupation
with acting is appropriate here but wherein Hamlet was involved with
the family romance of Orestes -- the murder of the father, the son's
revenge on the mother --  (granted, Alexander feels dominated by
"Mother" Adilade's world) here the family romance is compounded with an
Oedipal touch as well. When father and son sit alone among the trees,
Alexander's hamletesqe silioquy progresses until he loses touch with
his son altogether. When he realises he has slipped into some peculiar,
distant, not- very -fatherly character, his son returns and suprises
him as a threat, attacking him from behind and there is bloodshed. Just
talking about action brings harm to Little Man. 


What sort of dark scenareo lies behind this situation where the boy's
ability to speak (certainly his only mode of power) has been sugically
removed by the elder men of the film? We can't deny that this has the
religious ring as a kind of imposed "vow" of silence. But what kind of
spirituality is this? 


No, none of these notions are logical but Alexander's mental state is
not relaible in the film. He appears to be growing paranoid about what
he has unconsously orchestrated... As the "Garden story"...Alexander
says: "My God what have I done?"


In the infernal regions of the unconscious children are routenly
sacrificed for the transmission of familial and cultural purposes and
love and murder mingle as the very air is filled with the invisable
forces of violent attractions and repulsions. This potential rage of
war and plunder is constantly  if only slightly being diverted by our
daily words and actions. Death stands at our side. What kind of world
is this that we are unloading on our children? One might try to move
away to an island or a distant mountain only to find the enemy is us.


No, Alexander does not quite appear to be this neurotic but hints of
these things seem to be circling him as the film develops. As the slow
descent into the night suggests we are heading toward a point of
reversal, where we suddenly  see these ominous imaginary forces
suddenly flip onto the forground. Via a consensus of fear.


I think Sacrifice is the film most commited to T's dipiction of dream
style. Where people talk and act not as the characters themselves but
as perverted characters. Everyone is filtered through the oneric
perception of ONE character. There are extended sequences in "Solaris"
and "Stalker" and shorter flourishes in the rest but Sacrifice is
devoted for the most part to the underside of the waking life.  the "45
min 'chunks', or cycles. = to the biorythmic patterns of perceptual
activity" are REM cycles, roughly. 


The reversal is completed at the end of the film as Alexander takes the
sacrifice upon himself, imposing the silence upon himself seems -in
this context an act of faith that his son will no need the forced hand
of the father and by extention our culturations. Not a small act of
faith having seen the horrible swarms of hidden motives that humans
have, the unearthly powers that collective action is intended to
cultivate. 


When Abraham embraced the horrific religion of the locals having heared
the command of GOd to sacrifice his only child, he too displayed a
momentary faith in the most offensive kind of pagan practice our
civilisation has seen.  But this <italic>Akkida </italic> was an ironic
"binding": it was the binding that liberates.  For as maddening as it
is there is a quality in our best efforts to rid the world of evil that
is itself destructive. Our religions, our science, our predispositions,
codes of certainties are all "endless approximations". As always T was
advancing a paradox that we needn't worry about losing our fearful grip
on understanding, because when we do what will we find will only be
more of our understanding. Supressing negativity does not make it so--
even if it does produce "revelations". These are still only foolish
consistancies.


Its hard to remember the first impression of a film that takes repeated
screenings to appreciate but its clear that when Alexander burns the
house we are lead to suspect that Little Man may have been inside. The
monstrosity of Alexanders madness is only relived when we get that cut
to Little Man as he carries the water to the tree.  How ever much time
has passed is not clear but our relife indicates for the first time an
end to the nightmare.


Though it isn't clear that T <italic>knew</italic>  he was dying of
cancer when he made the film (TWT 348-9) being the morbidly aware soul
that he was I think its safe to say he knew he was dying when he
<italic>first began  </italic>making films. But like a Buddist T was
always imposing an optimism on his dour perception of life, family,
God, spirituality, art, film and religion. Letting go was his raison
detre... Letting go of his father, his mother, wife, children and his
films.  Letting go of interpretations -- the final judgment of this
terrific world of sublime highs and lows. 


Was <italic>Fear  </italic>the God that drove Alexander? He's not
saying. He only shows us the best that he can imagine.


Kierkigaard  imagined Abraham pretending to be insane so that his son
would not blame god for the madness, ALexander also hopes to take the
madness of the world upon himself, and free his son from a damning
predisposition. The world is redeemed. 


But what can we say in the audience?  He has again bound his son in a
knot of his own invention. T does not untie this knot for us, with his
film. The film is ours, its loops are the <italic>akkida  </italic>of
our own imagination. T only belies his choice in the dedication ... "hi
mom"!


<paraindent><param>right,right,right,left,left,left</param>Poetry whose
hidden subject is the anxiety of influence is naturally of a Protestant
temper, for the Protestant God always seems to isolate His children in
the terrible double bind of two great injunctions; "Be like Me" and "Do
not presume to be too like Me."

</paraindent>

Aphrodite misreads Shavarnez but we appreciate that when it is
provocative (and not too hurtful, I remind myself) . Actualy we can
have it no other way, because if we are not wasting our time here we
might be taking a bit of the poetic personality from T for ourselves.
If it was too presumptious for T himself to think that we are his
poetic partners do we dare not concede that we too become like the
poets who create and rapsodise as H Bloom says " by misreading one
another, so as to clear imaginative space for themselves" (Anxiety of
Influence P5)


We take these poetic movies into ourselves; after gestation and birth
we are unable to scorn them for thier weaknesses for they are
<italic>our  </italic>children now and to condemn them is to condemn
ourselves. Of course we are human and find that we can compensate by
shunting our disappontements through our contempt toward other people's
undisciplined kids.  My Tarkovsky is authentic --yours is not.


The solopsism is troubling , inevitable and a  sign of sychophancy I
suppose but it isn't sychophancy if we participate with the artist.
Still this requires an inordinant amount of unseeming trust toward one
"artist"/leader/mentor. Lots of time and gestation.  A devotion that
might appear distateful in others. We might call it obsessive but as
Mr. Bloom points out this is the nature of how a poets offspring
suffers as things are passed on -- not just consumed -- one "peers in
the mirror of his fallen precursor and beholds neither the precursor
nor himself but a Gnostic double, the dark otherness or antithesis that
both he and the precursor longed to be, yet feared..."


Is it so unatural to hope that we should do something with what we have
taken from this filmaker? Perhaps he was a person we might have known,
not a star of our projected ambition.  We needen't aspire to be famous
or earth shattering --- simply creative in our own impenatrable private
worlds -- that is the better part of being a "follower" no?  My hope is
that the music we share does not turn our bodies into a public
marketplace.



Sorry for the long, sloppy and turgid rush...

Hey Scott


You dense EuroAmera-centric ass, among the multitude of typos in your
last dispeptic post I feel compelled to re-enforce that Sarvenaz' name
is spelled (as well as pronounced) "Sarvenaz" and not "Shavarnez" as
you presumably dashed off in a flavoured coffee crazed hurry. 


I suppose I could also remark that the Hebrew word "akkeda" is better
transliterated "akedah" but where would it end? God forbid I should
make you look too confused.

<< By the way, Seamus, do you have a crush on Aphrodite?  That's very

  >>

More of a tried and true friendship. This list saw a truly exciting period for
a few months around the beginning of the year. Aphrodite and Scott (among
others) were key members that made the golden era of this list as golden as it
was. I'm an intellectual sentimentalist--rather than a lover--I'm afraid. I
long for the good old days more than I pine for virtual goddesses. Still, it
is always nice toknow that I can pass for charming. Ordinarily, I am
characterized as the detached and analytical one.

Aphrodite:

You make some interesting points.

a: as per Nostalghia. I agree that there is much that my observations does not
speak to. Domenico is an enigmatic figure--a repressed side of Gorchakov, I
think (hence the dream sequence where G sees D in the mirror). Part of
Nostalghia is concerned with the abandonment of motherhood--Eugenia is not
maternal in the least. Note that the images of babies are usually unhealthy
(that painting in Domenico's place is creepy, as is the detritus ridden baby
that is among the debris in the drowned pool at the end). I think this is part
of Domenico's significance within the interpretation I have been developing:
remember that he attempts to confine his wife and children. This is the
opposite of G., who flees his own wife and children. Again, I'm still working
on these issue--but they're irrefutably there. (I was heartened to find that
you found my observations "obvious"--when I mentioned them months ago I had to
defend them against your dear old friend mario almost daily!)

b: I do not tend to see Alexander as being emblematic of God. His act of
sacrifice is truly Christlike, if anything. He sacrifices himself that life
might continue--the difficulty is that Little Man must now live by his
father's actions. If you want to pursue the Xian interpretation: Little Man is
the first Xian, struggling to live by the Chrstilike example of his father--it
is noteworthy that the line "In the beginning was the word . . ." is from the
Book of John. But this interpretation has many problems, and it is probably
best to concede that, though Alexander has Christlike attributes towards the
end, that he is not meant to BE Christ.

Hmmmm.

At any rate, I hope I have established my true thesis: that the Sacrifice is
anything but one of Tark's weakest films.

Seamus

Scott:

<< "words ,
 words, words ...If only I could DO something." >>

It is interesting that Alexander says this . . . and AFTER he has said "In the
beginning was the word. . ."  The rest of that quote from John, of course, is
"and the word was God." The word goes from a position of divinity to a
position of triviality (words words words.). This hints, I suppose, at the
path that Little Man will follow. He may quote John in the end . . . but like
his father he will probably move to "words words words"--and perhaps also to
renouncing words altogether.

I agree with what you say about The Sacrifice and dreaming--though I would
again argue that Nostalghia is linked to the Sacrifice in this way as well.
Nostalghia lapses into and out of dreams almost constantly.

just a little note about the soundtracks i hope may prove helpful for
those of us who don't plan on visitng japan anytime soon...  a japanese
label has pressed them, true, however, they are *not* only available in
japan.  in fact, i've seen them in the racks of many of the local music
marts around NYC selling for about 30 bucks.  if you'd rather buy them
online, (for about the same price i believe), you can go to the forced
exposure website at...

http://www.forcedexposure.com

and purchase all four volumes worth.  i've only been able to afford Volume
4 so far, and i'm very impressed by the music, the beautiful packaging,
etc.  perhaps Jocelyn of american.edu (?) could provide the list with
reviews of these records?  i'm no good at reviews and i know i'd
appreciate them. anyway, i hope this helps...oh, one last note, speaking
of "soundtracks", i'd also like to recommend the Jean-Luc Godard double
disc off the ECM label that came out last year...it's unlike any listening
experience i've ever had, mainly b/c of the weird way it's structured
...everything from Schoenberg to Patti Smith...  and if that's not enough,
check out the film scores Toru Takemitsu composed...essential...

have fun,
eric.

Hey Scott,

Your post is so full of interesting ideas and possibilities it's
frustrating not to be able to elaborate and pin some of them down with you
(for lack of time, and the need to really do this kind of brainstorming in
the instant give and take of a real conversation if each of our "creative"
misunderstandings of each other are not to proliferate into a truly
profound solipsism!).

But anyway, a couple of points that I really didn't get and a comment or two.

>
>But what can we say in the audience?  He has again bound his son in a knot
>of his own invention. T does not untie this knot for us, with his film.
>The film is ours, its loops are the akkida  of our own imagination. T only
>belies his choice in the dedication ... "hi mom"!

The dedication is to his son Andrei...a statement of hope for him and his
future. How does this belie the thematic you've been sketching in here? And
what do you mean by "his choice"? Also what is akkida?

>The solopsism is troubling , inevitable and a  sign of sychophancy I
>suppose but it isn't sychophancy if we participate with the artist. Still
>this requires an inordinant amount of unseeming trust toward one
>"artist"/leader/mentor. Lots of time and gestation.  A devotion that might

>fallen precursor and beholds neither the precursor nor himself but a
>Gnostic double, the dark otherness or antithesis that both he and the
>precursor longed to be, yet feared..."

Mailing list discussions like this are a kind of creative flexing that
presumably we don't find elsewhere (or we probably wouldn't be here). I'm
not a poet but poetic associations, ambiguities and paradoxes have always
interested me. The same kinds of subjective (mis)readings show up on the
Nick Drake list, and no doubt I contribute my share. Yes it can be
obsessive but it's our passionate response to something, someone who has
read our minds as it were. I don't know if we ever become the  Gnostic
double that Bloom talks about but to uncover one's thoughts about what
continues to touch one deeply is liberating somehow. It can take time
though to write with enough accuracy to be understood, and I often feel
that most people don't take the time to elaborate to the point where what
they say can be responded to without compounding the confusion or merely
exchanging generalities. Though I guess all any of us can do is put
something out there and see...

Obviously I agree with the general idea, but your last sentence confuses
me. Surely this is at best exactly a disembodied form of communion, and not
the better for that! Not one I find satisfying even for as supposedly
"spiritual" a subject as T. So please explain your paradox or metaphor for
the intellectual stragglers among us.

Thankyou for the music information being past around.  I recently witnessed
Nostalghia on a big screen in Berkeley.  I was too tormented to stay and
view The Sacrifice afterwords (although i have viewed it on my TV which
does the film no justice, I am sure).  I was wondering if anyone knew of a
way to get a hold of Tarkovsky's diaries... I believe the english print is
titled TIME WITHIN TIME.  Thanks,

Jasen

<x-rich>Hey Tony


Good to hear from you. Yes, I'm sorry I didn't have time to clear up
such confusion as I obviously could have. I like to be eliptical but
some things were simply left unedited.



<paraindent><param>right,right,right,left,left,left</param>>>But what

</paraindent>

About the dedication, you're right--another blunder.

 

The point was that I think the film ends without t commiting himself to
an interpretation to the dream he has shown us. Is there a "God" at
all? Is the son set upon any better course - with our without a God or
father (culture, patriarchal or whatever). 


T is perceptive to the point of leaving us profoundly disturbed, a real
choice can only be ours. His dedication "with hope and confidence" is
his most honest way of including his personal interpretation/choice.
That choice being to <italic>believe</italic> (?) that all the horrors
that we might dream to be haunting our actions may or may not be
ultimate causes (secret motives, suppressed nature, unconscious freud
((joke?)) But even if they are at the root of our limited being are
they  at the root of life/existence?.  


It's possible that beyond our understanding something we could describe
as an ultimate "good" intention may be "out" there.  Science might say
we have a fifty fifty chance in the war between light and darkness.
Such things are only a matter of opinion - science cannot help us where
we need help most. At the bottom of it all.


Over simply, T shows us a glass with water in it. He comments that he
thinks it's half full.



Akedah in Hebrew means "binding".


The "Akedah" is the term used in Jewish studies to refer to Abrahams
trial with his son Isaac. You know the story about God commanding
Abraham to sacrifice his "son, his only son" the son he had been
promised for forty some odd years  ... 


Abraham nearly goes through with the murder of the child but is
deterred at the last moment by an angel.


(BTW Muslems say it was not<italic> Isaac  </italic>who was involved,
it was his first son<italic> Ishmael</italic>  born of Abraham's
concubine Hagar).

Your misunderstanding is quite worthy! My intention may prove less
interesting -- but I explain: It is a referance to the rock and roll
bit between Sarvenaz and Aphrodite. I did make a sort of leap there.


This is a big subject. My opinion is that the intimate relationship
that popular music achieves with our personal bodies is openly degraded
by its publicity and proffessionalism -- which seems to be an
inevatable consequence of capatalism. My problem is I simply can no
longer ignore this when pursuing my needs there.  The natural conduits
between the music and our dancing reactions have strings attached. The
profiteer has greater and greater influence into my body. Unredeemably.
I have lost "hope and confidence " in the interests of the music
"icons".


Though I find it harder and harder to dance around the deception I do
manage every now and then. There are notable exceptions in the mix and
I do break down and purchase a ditty - for the body's sake.  Even a
prostitue needs love in whatever way he might manage to puchase it for
himself.

Scott, you write:

<< Hey thats the best direction of thought yet concerning why
 LM asks that question at the end. It's always been sort of lost on me.
 I simply saw it as a devoted child's obedient imatation, and not taken
 the actual question seriously.
 
 
 Jesus Christ, he's already doubting deeply! Doubting God and doubting
 his father's silence... <italic>literaly </italic>questioning the
 silence.
 
 
 Thanks for the alignments Seamu

Thanks. It was your quoting Hamlet that prompted me--so thanks for that too. I
have to admit. I got goose bumps when I came up with it.

I went a pretty long time before being able to get a copy of the diaries.
There's no easy answer to this--they're out of print. The best method (the one
that scored me a nice hardback for $20) is to search www.mxbf.com every few
weeks or so. This is a search engine that simultaneously checks Amazon, and
five or six other used bookstore posting sites from around the world. There
are literally thousands of new and used bookstores all over the world posting
books of all kinds on these sites and MX Bookfinder searches them all
simultaneously.

I checked a minute ago and there was nothing listed--but it will turn up. It
took a couple of months for me to find it.

Bardamu:

I'd watch Nostalghia and The Sacrifice next. In that order or on consecutive
nights. Try not to watch anything in between--and watch them twice if
possible. Tall orders, I know, but it truly helps.

Hello list,

	Passion According to Saint Andrew (Strasti po Andreiu) will be aired
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow (September 3 and 4) twice on Russian TV
channel Kul'tura. Total time of two parts is 3 hours 15 min, so I guess
this is a full version of Andrei Rublev. Could somebody in Moscow tape it
for me?

Vladimir

And in French the title is 'Le temps scelle (avec accent aigu sur le
'e' [niark!]', published by "Les cahiers du cinema". If someone read
french, i can make a little gesture.

And I said: Please, take me off the list,
cerebral games, two-cent-analysis (and for French "masturbation
intellectuelle"), because if Tarkovski made intellectual movies
(truely, it's not Hollywood Planet Movies), it's not a reason to talk
and talk about him. You forget the "Body" in T. movies.
I hoped the discussion was about "movies" and not "body and soul of
Tarkovski." 
When I read "The sacrifice is not really good", at least,
cinematographily (??) this movie is a great lesson on making-movie.
But, nevermind; the discussion begun to be interesting when someone
compared T. with Lynch (when i saw T. movies i'd got the impression
that Lynch was a young young boy).
No, it's not the case there. You look at you when you write your mail,
talking like good "students", repeating lessons. And not ask movie
questions (plan-sequences, construction, narration, etc., etc.)




It's a good regret.

Unless you're a musician you're not the prostitute! Are you literally
referring to dance music or to the whole popular music business and how our
bodies (and minds too sometimes) are colonized by the entertainment
industry?

Since I run my own record label I'm interested in these questions. I don't
want to take up much list bandwith on something this off-topic. But there
are other ways for the body to be moved by music than by the big beat. I'm
rather partial to the fragmented pulse-shards of avant-jazz, which, taken
to its extreme, destroys the beat by filling it in with everything it isn't
- and therefore allows you to move with any aspect of rhythm you respond to
from moment to moment (the acid of jazz? but not acid-jazz, which is surely
misnamed...). Of course most people can't stand the stuff, but its
anti-hierarchical form, in-the-moment collectively improvised nature, and
lack of commercial exploitability make it the most democratic music I know.

"Andrei Passion" (I prefer that translatioon) version is available on 
the Criterion laserdisk. The ruuning time totals to 205 minutes. If you 
can playback NTSC tape, give me a word, and I would send you a copy. I 
am currently trying to make a converted copy of it in PAL for someone 
else, but this project gives me enormous trouble, and would not be 
available for at lest 60 days. Also watch out for the correct aspect 
ratio. Last time I saw it aired on Russian NTV channel at the aspect 
ratio of 1.85:1 instead of correct 2,35:1. Needless to say this hurts 
Tarkovsky's compositions by cropping a frame.
Alex

<x-rich>Tony,

Thanks for not taking my anti music rag too personal. I think its a
condition of our culture and not due to anyone's deliberate abuse. My
whole family are musicians, undoubtedly making this a sensitive subject
for me.


<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>>Unless you're a
musician you're not the prostitute! 

</paraindent>

Yeah I can see that. I was not a very good  musician, I could never get
over the dirty feeling.

<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>

</paraindent>It's hard to express. Putting  money aside for a moment.
To me it feels like the popular "musician" today is pursuing identity
through territory (amassing an audience) ... and
<italic>bodies</italic>  are that territory. The music is the medium of
exchange. The "audience" gets more than sensual gratification, we get
identity through service... belonging.


Music is no longer simple, its full of cultural information...
semiotics and such. Music is flashed around for status. The idea that
art is more valuable than money is an old verity, now become a cliche
due to its availability. We might call this "aesthetic inflation".


But the bottom line is how it feels. Not just that we realize one day
that our emotions have been exploited but that even the emotions
themselves were unfounded. As if we were cultivated for this, from
childhood. As you said..."colonized by the entertainment industry".


<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>>I'm rather partial to
the fragmented pulse-shards of avant-jazz, which, taken

>to its extreme, destroys the beat by filling it in with everything it
isn't

>- and therefore allows you to move with any aspect of rhythm you
respond to

>from moment to moment ... Of course most people can't stand the stuff,
but its

>anti-hierarchical form, in-the-moment collectively improvised nature,
and

>lack of commercial exploitability make it the most democratic music I
know.

</paraindent>

Very sophisticated stuff, I love it too... from Coleman to Zorn... but
the desperation. Like women who wear veils to protect themselves from
exploitation. But its treatment of the body is more severe than that,
isn't it? It's more like those medieval chastity belts of iron. It's
hard to have immediate personal pleasure when  we are so defensive.
Media is too good.


One of the composers that is on that CD "Homage to Andrie Tarkovsky"
seems to be appropriate here. Luigi Nono. I don't know exactly how he
works but I know he has a great interest in chance, if not
improvisation per se.

I ordered a copy from the Internet Bookshop, in England. I live in
Chile, so I thought it would be a hassle. It took less than a month in
getting to my hands, delivered at my own house. And it wasn't
expensive at all. I'd say like 30 dollars including delivery all the
way over here. 

Try it out.

It would be very helpful to everybody on the list if the postmaster could
configure the server to append the below instruction in _every_ message.

Hi all,

	Incase you don't remember me, I'm a composition (music) student ant the U
of Washington, and just finished an independent study on tark.  A couple of
you had expressed interest in reading my paper when I was done, and I'm
done!  Keep in mind, I'm just an undergrad... ;)
	Shall I put it in an email, or have people ask me for it?  Also, tell me,
if you can, how those cd's sound.  Has anyone bought them from forced
exposure yet?

Hey Ben

Glad you're back!

Sign me up for a copy. It wouldn't bother me none if you wanted to post it
on the list. I know it feels like forced exposure but chances are I and a
few others may want to talk a bit about it. Otherwise...

"Bring it ovah!"

(Deniro--Raging Bull)

I've got all the Tark CDs (speaking of forced ex) and I did write some
stuff months ago. I'll pull it up and go over it with some updates since
everybody wants to know about them --- I'll try to resist amusing myself
with esoteric obfuscations I guess...

"Right now I gotta git goin!"

In a message dated 98-09-03 03:05:24 EDT, you write:

<< And not ask movie
 questions (plan-sequences, construction, narration, etc., etc.)
  >>

Discussions of form are not as important as discussions of content--though the
two should be linked wherever possible. You're a formalist, maybe even a
structuralist--and repeating lessons of your own. Your above suggestion
reminds me of people who would rather talk commas and periods than the meaning
of a poem.

I, too, would like a copy (and yes, I do remember you.) Please send it to me
directly whether or not you post it to the group as a whole.

Avant-jazz can be pretty sensual, and certainly very physical, along with
its sometimes more intellectual pleasures, don't you think? With what's
called energy music you can experience an almost oceanic engulfment by that
excess of stimlulation striking you in waves that keep chaotically
intersecting until you find yourself the still point at the center (static
and ecstatic)....With another, sparer group you might be focusing on the
whole space in which the unpredictable interweaving of sound events is
occuring until your mind and senses fuse in a hyperreceptive state. I only
get defensive if I'm really tired, because then the music often overwhelms
me so I have to push it away, keep it "out there". But when I'm up for it,
and it's really good (of course lots of it is little more than banging
around), I can't think of any other music that so opens me up to the moment
of creation, *every* moment  And to make such music, at its best, must be
feel creation itself flowing through you. What more could anyone ask?

I hope this doesn't sound like a commercial. But I do think that many
people who like Tarkovsky for the space his films open up (both physical
and psychic) would like at least the more reflective and thoughtfully
structured end of avant-jazz quite a lot. As a producer I've worked with a
number of NY based artists like Ellery Eskelin and Chris Speed whose music
has that inner intensity I associate with T.

 >One of the composers that is on that CD "Homage to Andrie Tarkovsky"
seems to be appropriate here. Luigi Nono. I don't know exactly how he works
but I know he has a great interest in chance, if not improvisation per se.

Once the cameras were rolling of course T wasn't an improvisor (for that
you need a much cheaper format than 35mm!). Haven't heard a lot of
contemporary classical music and can't comment on Nono. I find most
serial-inspired music for example just too abstract and intellectual, often
not sensually appealing in its textures/timbres and style of enunciation
(phrasing etc.), and not really engaging rhythmically. I know, I know, I'm
a philistine. But sometimes these contemporary classical guys seem like
constipated wankers compared to the great jazz player/composers. And I'd be
glad for anyone's recommendations here: "avant-garde music T might have
liked".

Yes maybe i'm a formalist (lol), maybe i'm a structuralist (i read
some books about 
this way of LOOKING, but as you know, above all structuralism is  used
in Science 
(even if some movie critics/analysts use this method - and semiotic
and others things 
like that). 

BUT, if i'm a formalist (lol) and a structuralist (LOL), the way to
classify me
is just little bit INSANE. (Are you a human structuralizer ? :-) ) I
just want to talk 
about plan-sequences and construction, and talk about that, it's also
to talk about 
Tarkovski LANGUAGE and these movies. Why should we occult these things
? Music and relation 
between T. and Mr. Smith,  truely,  what's that fuck ??!! Pure
masturbation and a 
good way to don't talk MOVIE. Blablablabla and blablablabla and good
music and blablablabla 
and toto and blablablabla and T. homosexual ??? and blablablabla Tark.
fucked Princess Diana ???
 sucked by Leonardo DiCaprio ?? Noo ?? and blablalblalblabla

So i just wait some guys and girls who'll write about MOVIES and not
about things AROUND
MOVIES. 

(Just a question: why americans are so complexed by the European
Culture ? Your attitude is a
 reaction of frustration. In Europe, to talk about structuralism it's
really ridiculous. Nobody use this word (if you want to be on the top
of the wave culture read Derrida and the Diplomatic World (Le monde
diplo' est je crois édité dans toute l'Europe (Grek, Deutch, etc.) ) 
You don't even have the sense of ridicule. But you're good advantaged:
i don't speak your 
LANGUAGE)

Not only Alexanders's sacrifice seems to be christlike. There are 
also other things that could be interpreted as christlike attributes. 
When A.takes his bike to get to the Witch during the night, he falls 
down on the road a couple of times, just like Jesus did when he had 
to carry the cross...

Okay, you got my attention on that one<italic>. JLG  </italic>is a
grossly underappreciated film, as was <italic>Helas Pour Moi</italic>.
I think Goddard is as good as ever -- unfortunately he gets little
distribution around here. 


Strange... one of my dearest friends in Louisiana designs Tee shirts.
He sells quite a bit to buyers in France, Italy, Japan and elsewhere.
Wouldn't it be funny if you were wearing one?


As far as movy making goes, I know more than some -- less than others. 
Here's something I think is quite interesting. Are you familiar
with<italic> Dogma 95?  </italic>I don't know much about them but
there's an affinity for Tarkovsky in them, I think. They are a
collective of film directors founded in Copenhagen in Spring 1995... (I
was told Lars Van Trier was involved) 


Dogma 95 counters the film of illusion by setting for themselves an
indisputable set of rules know as the "Vow Of Chastity".



"I swear to submit to the following set of rules drawn up and confirmed
by Dogma 95:


1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be
brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location
must be chosen where this prop is to be found.)


2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice
versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is
being shot.)


3. The camera must be hand held. Any movement or immobility attainable
in the hand is permitted. (The film must not take place where the
camera is standing; shooting must take place where the film takes
place.)


4. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If
there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a
single lamp be attached to the camera.)


5. Optical work and filters are forbidden.


6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons,
etc. must not occur.)


7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say
that the film takes place in the here and now.)


8. Genre movies are not acceptable.


9. The film format must be Academy 35mm.


10. The director must not be credited.


Furthermore I swear as a director to refrain from personal taste. I am
no longer an artist. I swear to refrain from creating a 'work', as I
regard the instant as more important than the whole. My supreme goal is
to force the truth out of my characters and settings. I swear to do so
by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any
aesthetic considerations.


Thus I make my Vow of Chastity."

In a message dated 98-09-04 04:05:02 EDT, you write:

<< Just a question: why americans are so complexed by the European

 You don't even have the sense of ridicule. But you're good advantaged:

I don't recall saying I was perplexed by European culture. I have read Derrida
(as well as Foucault, Barthes, Kristeva, Zizek, Baudrillard, and so on). My
background is in literary theory and I am well aware of the obsolescence of
Structuralism--which is why I lashed out so vehemently against your desire to
talk about technical and structural aspects of Tark's movies. I assumed that
you were attacking the interpretations of The Sacrifice etc. that I and others
had offered--if you were, instead, attacking silly discussions of Tarkovsky's
homosexuality, etc. then I agree with you.

I have consistedly pointed to Tarkvosky's technical innovations in my postings
over the months while also having to defend hermeneutic approaches to his work
time and again. So perhaps I was hasty. If I misunderstood your post, then I
am sorry. It sounded to me like you wanted to move away from interpretative
discussions of Tarkovsky and towards the sort of technical discussions that
are virtually the sole characteristic of American film criticism: critics in
this country can talk about angles and shot length for years without even
hinting that maybe a film actually has something to say. Formalism (in the
form of New Criticism) is still the pervasive approach to cinema in this
country--we look at the structure, length, and all the externals without ever
delving into content and the place of the film within larger contexts.

I am sorry that there is a language barrier--I'm afraid that, despite having
studied each for a time, my French, German, and Spanish are all inifinitely
inferior to your English.

You got me there. Who are these folks? (experimental rock?)

As for categories, it's a convenience...I'm just interested in discovering
music that somehow, to you, resonate in a way that corresponds to T's
cinema (not necessarily the music in his films).

Go right ahead, I'm interested in T's language. It's just harder to talk
about structure in any detail if you don't have the films to look at again
and again, and I don't...

 Why should we occult these things

Well, one reason would be because things can gain meaning in relation to
each other, and in particular an artist's work and life intersect in so
many ways (particularly T's) that to ignore that is to limit the
possibilities of understanding who he was. Another reason maybe would be so
as not to continually repeat lessons 1 to 10 of Tarkovsky Appreciation
100...

Speaking of ridicule, now you're putting us on again aren't you? Surely
Derrida isn't still the darling of the cultural theorists? All that stuff
is important up to a point, but its (mostly) materialistic basis doesn't
really account for what makes Tarkovsky interesting. That doesn't mean
that, say, a Freudian analysis of T might not reveal something new (though
A Visual Fugue already had a few things to say along those lines), but you
don't want to talk about any of that anyway.

But you're good advantaged:
>i don't speak your
>LANGUAGE)

You're right, English speakers have an unfair advantage. There's nothing we
can do about it, so please don't hold it against us. And it doesn't prevent
anyone from posting in French or Russian or whatever to this list, does it?
Or starting their own.

In a message dated 98-09-04 14:16:44 EDT, you write:

<< It sounded to me like you wanted to move away from interpretative
 discussions of Tarkovsky and towards the sort of technical discussions that
 are virtually the sole characteristic of American film criticism >>

Obviously content and meaning are the important things, but don't dismiss
entirely the value of a brief discussion of structure.  After all, Tarkovsky
didn't psychically beam his ideas into our heads, he used sepcific actors,
settings, and yes, even camerawork.  Seamus, don't worry about defending
yourself.  One cannot watch this list for very long and doubt the breadth of
your scholarship.

But back to Nostalghia.  I have to agree somewhat with Aphrodite, I don't
think it's really a film about (certainly not for) women.  In many of his
films I keep seeing Parsifal, if you'll forgive me for getting a bit Jungian.
I keep seeing the wounded Fisher King, waiting for a holy fool to ask a
healing question.  This is a very male theme.  I keep thinking that if I pay
close enough attention to these films (except Solaris which I consider a
special case, more on that later) I'll find a map, one which will show me a
way to ... I'm not quite sure what.

<x-rich>Hey Tony


<paraindent><param>right,right,right,right,left,left,left,left</param>>Once
the cameras were rolling of course T wasn't an improvisor ....

</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right,right,right,right,left,left,left,left</param>>I
only get defensive if I'm really tired, because then the music often
>overwhelms...

</paraindent>

Sorry for the mistake, I was referring to musicians in both cases. 


The defensiveness I was talking about was what I hear in the music,  in
the strategies of creating music that indeed does reach the body (yes I
agree) but only by a dis-orginisation/ re-orginization. (Artaud's
<italic>body without organs  </italic>perhaps?) The corruptions in the
direct relationships between mind, body, ear and instrument have become
so noisy that some musicians resort to extreme methods to return to
sensual pleasure. Don't get me wrong I like it. We don't have much
choice left do we?


Artists like these have a kind of mission that once was an assault on
bourgeois taste but I don't see the term avant garde as appropriate due
to the crumbling faith in community.  It suggests an uniformity in the
ranks that can't be presumed anymore. I sort of think of these
aesthetic assaults as "sorties" and more analogous to terrorists. But
terrorism is only so if it is a public threat, and musicians cannot
pose an aesthetic force without some kind of representation in numbers,
a movement.  Hence my sense of futility. 


In the closing scene of<italic> Nostalghia </italic> the relationship
between the images, music and our bodies is disrupted. The <italic>Ode
to Joy </italic> is "cut up" in the diegesis  - from within the scene.
Curiously,  cutting the music achieves the same ends for Tark that he
gets by <italic>not</italic>  cutting the images. Again T cannot bring
himself to editorialize, to enforce his choice.  T cannot bring himself
to employ music as emotional soundtrack, acknowledging that we should
no longer trust the simple relationships we have with culture/artists. 
Of course as always he would have his cake and eat it too, but clearly
the consumption is wrought with mistrust. 


Recalling that the original ending of <italic>Nostalghia</italic>  was
to have Gorchakov killed by a stray bullet from a terrorists gun and so
I quote form the Italian Terrorist Gianfranco Sanguinetti:


<paraindent><param>right,right,right,left,left,left</param>All acts of
terrorism, all the outrages which have struck and which strike the
imagination of men, have been and are either offensive actions or
defensive actions. If they form part of and offensive strategy,
experience has shown for a long time that they are always doomed to
fail. If, on the other hand, they form part of a defensive strategy,
experience shows that these acts can expect some success, which,
however is only momentary and precarious. (On Terrorism and the State
P57)

</paraindent>

When the anxiety of influence expands into a historical nightmare we
struggle to willfuly wake ourselves. At that liminal moment in between
dreaming and awakening having no control over the body can be the most
terrifying moment of all.


S

<< Obviously content and meaning are the important things, but don't dismiss
 entirely the value of a brief discussion of structure.  After all, Tarkovsky
 didn't psychically beam his ideas into our heads, he used sepcific actors,
 settings, and yes, even camerawork. >>

I agree with this wholheartedly--and in my intitial post I did try to make
this clear. Obviously one needs to talk about the work itself in order to talk
about meaning--my concern is when structure (etc.) becomes the alpha and omega
of a discussion. I'll talk tracking shots, long takes, jump cuts, dissolves,
and swish pans forever if I think it will amount to something. And certainly
Tarkovsky made some important technical and aesthetic decisions over the
years--long takes, use of sound, internal rhythm, etc.

<<But back to Nostalghia.  I have to agree somewhat with Aphrodite, I don't
think it's really a film about (certainly not for) women.  In many of his
films I keep seeing Parsifal, if you'll forgive me for getting a bit Jungian.
I keep seeing the wounded Fisher King, waiting for a holy fool to ask a
healing question.  This is a very male theme.  I keep thinking that if I pay
close enough attention to these films (except Solaris which I consider a
special case, more on that later) I'll find a map, one which will show me a
way to ... I'm not quite sure what.>>

Perhaps I overstated my case. It seems to me that this film deals more overtly
with women than any of Tark's other work (with the exception of Mirror). It
is, I agree, definitely not a woman's film, nor a film for women. I doubt
Tarkovsky could have ever made such a film. Perhaps I should say it is about
womanhood, or at least what Tarkovsky thinks womanhood should be. It is a male
take on women--but women are definitely a central theme, especially in their
roles as mothers.

If you'll allow me to put a Wagnerian spin on your Jungianism, I see more of
Tannhauser than Parzifal--though I do see what you mean. Here is G. suspended
between the ideal woman (his wife) and the ideal sexual woman (Eugenia). 

Remember, too, that my statement about the place of women in Nost. was made in
regards to connecting it to The Sacrifice which deals much more heavily with
men (esp. father and son). 

Thanks,

Seamus

i must confess that i've learned little about tarkovsky--though more about
the members of this group--from all the discussions that bombarded me
everyday. in the end i feel sorry for him, that his most devoted fans are
a rather limited group. he deserves better, i think. i myself will keep
watching his films whenever i get a chance, BUT TAKE ME OFF THIS LIST AS
WELL. one encounters enough nonsense and banality in daily life. 

h.y.

Hi Roman,

The scene with the horses and the apples at the beach, seems to me, a
'direct quotation' from 'Ivan's Childhood'. I find a more general influence
from Tarkovsky in the way of handling sequence shots in a dreamlike
fashion, but maybe I'm fooled by Trier's recurring remarks about trying to
escape the influence of Tarkovsky etc.

Henrik

Dear Friends,

I am intrigued by the verbal flings happening in our list and the only
thing which comes to my mind is the story of Babel.
Are we so helpless?

In this era of our existence, LIVING IS COMMUNICATION. Unless there is a
dialogue how can we communicate? If one decides unilaterally to end a
process of dialogue, is that helpful?

Isn't it necessary to consider, the concerned artist's expressed views on
why he create an object of art? Coming to opinions and methods of reading a
work of art, the primary thing we should always remember is that we are
speaking of a work of art, which is witnessed by us by our own uniquely
different ways.SO a Rose is NOT a Rose.

It is said that when Valmiki presented the great Indian Epic,"Ramayana"
he said," If thousand people read "Ramayana", then there will be
thousand new Ramayanas created." More so in Cinema. 

When we are discussing a work of art to understand it, we should have the
courage to see it from different angles and also not to overdo it beyond
its own intentions and definitions.

Then, why art? What are the functions of artists and philosophers in the
society? May be they create an "omnivalance" so that a dialogue occurs, and
through this dialogue a new meaning emerges, and through this new meaning,
a new reality is born![Hopefully a new reality for the better. Not another
Hiroshima]

We need not be afraid of words. After all we are created from word.

Let me quote Tarkovsky Himself now.

" Moreover, the great function of art is communication, since mutual
understanding is a force to unite people, and the spirit of communion is
one of the most important aspects of artistic creativity "

" In the end everything can be reduced to the one simple element, which is
all a person, can count upon in his existence: The capacity to Love.
That element can grow within the soul to become the supreme factor which
determines the meaning of a person's life. My function is to make whoever
sees my films aware of his need to love and to give his love, and aware
that beauty is summoning him."

I am afraid that, if Tarkovsky knows what is happening in our list -
prejudices and intolerance- he will not be all that happy.

Let cinema and discussions on cinema be an instrument of, understanding and
love, as Tarkovsky wished.

Long live CINEMA.

Sunny Joseph ISC.

Let me say that I agree with the spirit of your post and am all for open
dialogue etc., though it is important to remember that the infinite ways of
looking at a work could not possibly become manifest without disagreement.
Bickering, however, is another matter. And there has certainly been some of
that going on, though it has still been a good deal tamer than some of the
other discussions I have seen on this and other lists. 

However, as the self-appointed advocate of hermeneutics I feel obligated to
take issue with some of the other aspects of your post. 

One:

<<Isn't it necessary to consider, the concerned artist's expressed views on
why he create an object of art?>>

Frankly, no. Much has been written about the so-called "intentional fallacy"
over the years (see Roland Barthes and WK Wimsatt, in particular) and it has
been pretty well established that one need not have any concern or regard for
an artist's intentions, opinions, background, etc. Certainly, it is still AN
approach we can use, and not one that should be abandoned completely--but it
is also grounded in the idea that somehow an artist retains interpretive
ownership of a work. This simply isn't the case. Art is the property of those
who see it, etc. Moreover, the idea that an artist is responsible for CREATING
a work is also debatable--art like the artist is a product of society and of
other works (themselves products of the same). If we are to use the artist
him/herself as a point of reference then let's be honest: Tarkovsky is
responding to (rebelling against) the so-called Eisenstein aesthetic and is
largely informed by a Russian Orthodox background. Before Tarkovsky makes his
films he has been shaped by infinitely complex sources (the world) and after
the work is done those same sources (the world--infinitely changed) will
behold the work. Tarkovsky's own statements about his work are, ultimately,
nothing more than another interpretation of them.

<< When we are discussing a work of art to understand it, we should have the
 courage to see it from different angles and also not to overdo it beyond
 its own intentions and definitions.
  >>

I've never understood the idea that we should not "overdo it [interpretation]
beyond it [the work's] intentions and definitions." That's EXACTLY what we
should do. In fact, how could we do otherwise? And when exactly is one
"overdoing" it? As a literature major/student assistant I am consistently
hearing students complain of "overinterpretation." If an interpretation of a
work produces a beautiful or meaningful idea (and "beauty is truth, truth
beauty") then what difference does it make? What does it mean to understand a
work? And do we sincerely believe that the artist him or herself actually
understand the work? The work is felxible and can mean many things--so why
limit it? 

I, of course, love very much the two quotations that you select from
Tarkovsky--especially the one about the function of the artist being to
introuduce the capacity to love into the world. And I can honestly say that
his films have done this for me, among other things--but Tarkovsky also had
some very serious criticisms of society that he wished to introduce as well.
This, too, came from love. Love is not all agreement and communion--it is also
the desire and ability to be honest and to relish the complexity of the world.
In this list we have a miniature of that world and its complexity--but we are
limited to words and only words.

Ah, words. They are both our prisons and our means to freedom--as James Agee
wrote in an essay on photography:

"We are all so deeply caught in the tyranny of words, even where words are not
needed, that they have sometimes to be used as keys to unlock their own
handcuffs."

Sarvenaz, you wrote:

<< I hadn't considered Wagner.  I hate to admit it, but I'm prejudiced against
 Wagner.  I know that personal predjudice is no excuse for ignoring something
 important.  Could you tell me more about Tannhauser pls.?  And before anybody
 attacks Tark for being a woman-hating pederast, let us all take a moment to
 recall that we each have both a male and a female aspect, and no human
 experience need be alien.>>
 
 >>

Wagner, for all his faults (and God knows he had plenty of them), is well
worth your time. If it helps: like Tarkovsky he repeatedly uses redemption
through love as a major motif. Tannhauser is about a young man who is torn
between love of one woman (the earthly, maidenly, pure, Elizabeth--I think
that was her name) and the well known beacon of erotica that is Venus. When he
is with Elizabeth he lusts for the goddess Venus and when he is with Venus he
longs for the woman Elizabeth. Talk about dialectic! There is much more, of
course, but that is the basic gist of it. He also composed an opera based on
Parzifal that has some beautiful music in it.

As per your discussion of Tark as masogynist--it is a touchy point. I think he
had some less than progressive ideas about the place of women in society, and
that some of those ideas are especially manifest in Nostalghia. While I would
not go so far as to call him woman-hating, or a pederast, or a masogynist, I
definitely sense some resentment of women's libbers, etc.

Are you a Jungian?--your allusion to the amima and animus priniciple would
seem to indicate so. . .
  
<<OK, Seamus, I'm going to go back and re-read those old posts before I jump
 back in again, but I'll be watching. >>

Hey, don't split on me. This is just getting good. You're last few posts have
been the main reason I haven't unsubscribed again.

Any of us will readily admit that direct experience of the films is to be
preferred to discussion with a bunch of boors (like me).  Unfair, though, to
call Seamus & Scott nonsensical and banal.  This is not the Tarvkovksy
Learning Channel, after all:  if you have something enlightening to say, by

<<  And do we sincerely believe that the artist him or herself actually
 understand the work? >>

Anybody who writes, paints, composes, etc. will tell you that much of creation
is fortuitous.  Perhaps one takes note of an odd juxtaposition or perhaps one
takes dictation from one knows not quite where.  Certainly art is part lament
and part prophesy...

<< Tarkovsky also had some very serious criticisms of society that he wished

communion--it is also the desire and ability to be honest and to relish the

I'm glad you brought up the issue of complexity and communion.  I  remember
seeing Solaris (my Tarkovsky virginity -- the first of his films that I saw)
and being very PROFOUNDLY affected.  I emphasize the word profound because for
the first time in my squirrely, voluble life, I was speechless.  I could
barely comprehend this new knowledge much less name it, yet there I was, naked
as Adam, scared and excited and brand new to the world.  

I was not OUTSIDE this film.  I didn't want to know what the director was
trying to say, I wanted to know what the ocean wanted, what Kelvin understood.
There he is, a man of science, a level head sent up there to find out what had
happened, restore order, make sense of it all, and what does he come to
understand?  Not his colleagues, the planet, or even his dead wife, but only
something in himself.  

I don't think I'm a Jungian in particular but certainly my aim is not to
debrief Tarkovsky's cinema with abstruse analyses so much as it is to uncover
the hidden maps that will lead me to someplace kind and peaceful within
myself.  Whenever I my head out of whack I think of Solaris and it sort of
puts things in perspective:  what it is ever possible to know about other
people directly (very little) and what it possible to know about them through
self-examination (a lot).

(I'll go intellectual again next time, Seamus, just had to get this out.  You
know, flattery will get you everywhere with me.)

Sure, lots of choice, if we know where to start looking (the capitalist
distribution/marketing system is mainly what limits choice).

Don't you think that the main problem with commercial music (as well as
commercial cinema and TV) is that it fragments the self into these separate
targets, and mostly it's the appetites of the body that are being appealed
to (sensation, sensationalism, horror/gore/sex, "human interest"...)?

You don't need to destroy traditional musical values and structures
(rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, color etc.) to reinegrate the mind,
body, ear/instrument, and soul/emotion/spirit. In fact you'd better not
throw them out entirely, because they're what connects you to the domain of
music, and through it to other people.

Sometimes you hear defensiveness and protest, but I think the musicians who
are making a difference are on the offensive in this sense: they're
searching for and following their own muse, and often they're integrating
and extending not just their own (western) traditions, without prejudice of
"high"/classical or experimental  vs. "low" folk/popular culture, but also
what they find in musics from all over the world. At their best they're so
connected that they're free to improvise something of beauty and depth
together, one that includes the listener in a community which has never
existed before and will never exist in quite the same way again.

I see your point but there are other factors involved. Music cultures used
to be determined more by gatekeepers than they are now. In the CD age it's
not that hard to get your music out there, though it's still hard to get it
heard widely. Thus there is no single "reactionary" avant-garde movement in
music; music is multifarious and fragmented (in a perhaps good, anarchic
sense).

Also avant-garde art depended on a concept of received, socially sanctioned
"high" art that seems a lot less compelling these days (except maybe in
reference to public obscenity in puritan-dominated societies like the US).
If avant art isn't a public threat is that because artists lack faith in
(their) community, or because we now realize the arts have never been able
to channel or represent a mass threat to power?

Okay, but what about the final music in The Sacrifice (and some earlier
films)? It feels like an affirmation, even if not necessarily a simple one.
Maybe T is not trying to (underhandedly or otherwise) compel our agreement
through the power of music, but he is presenting his own statement of
memory/continuity, desire, and faith to us to take in in whatever way we
can.

>
>When the anxiety of influence expands into a historical nightmare we

>terrifying moment of all.

Extending the phrase "anxiety of influence" into a new, totalizing social
context makes sense. Our bodies, as Foucault showed, are moulded by
society, nor is anything about us really our own beyond the particular
accidents of our genes and upbringing and the illusions of our will.
Terrorists of any kind are thus waging a losing battle against the alien
social structures they feel have been inscribed over who they "really" are,
and which they are nevertheless reinforcing both in themselves and in the
world. Defensive terrorism is still terrorism, it's all too willful, and
it's aimed at destroying rather than building community, isn't it (at least
community outside the terrorists' cell)? You can admire their guts
(sometimes) without agreeing with their aims or methods. (Sorry if this
sounds banal...)

So how to wrest some sense of self or certainty in this waking dream,
without succumbing to the illusion that individual control or sense of
identity can save us, much less society? This is where I think art, both
solitary, introspective creativity and group work/play, really does have a
role. It's why I'm here yakking with people I'll probably never meet. It's
what you said last week in your "Friends and Lovers" post:

>Is it so unatural to hope that we should do something with what we have
>taken from this filmaker? Perhaps he was a person we might have known, not
>a star of our projected ambition.  We needen't aspire to be famous or
>earth shattering --- simply creative in our own impenatrable private
>worlds -- that is the better part of being a "follower" no?

Though maybe not that impenetrable...

There is an interesting book called Cinema and Painting, or something like
that (I don't have it handy) that has a chapter on Tarkovsky's use of icon
painting in Andrei Rubilev. The aesthetics of Russian icon painting are
fascinating, especially when applied to cinema--something Tarkovsky was
apparently trying to do. What you describe above is an example of the aim of
icon painting--who arrange the very composition of the painting so that the
vanishing point is off the canvas (i.e. within the real world). I think that
this is Tarkovsky's aim with the long take: to blur the distance between the
world and the film. Moreover, in icon painting, there is no difference between
signifier and signified (to lapse into postmodern parlance for a moment)--a
figure is not represented in an icon painting. They are PRESENT. 

One former member of the list was convinced (and I agree) that Hari in Solaris
was essentially an icon. Interesting idea.

This is also reminiscent of Longinus' idea of the Sublime--but that I'll save
for another day. I get self-conscious if I pontificate too much.

How do you like that?  I got suckered by the Russians.  It's true though, I'm
such a great audience, I always suspend my disbelief and crawl inside with the
characters.  I'm reading E.M. Cioran now, (Tears of Saints) and hope to return
to the list with some useful comments on the meaning of weeping, on sainthood,
and on suffering generally.  Pontificate at will.

I noticed that there is a poster of Nostalghia that features a scene that
is not in the film wherein Gorchakov is planting a big kiss on Eugenia.

I wonder if the marketing folks staged this scene or if it was ever
actaully in the film? A logical guess would be that if it is in the film it
probably took place early. It's easier for me to imagine that T would move
from sensuality to the acesticism. Having their passion appear late in the
film sort of implys that thats  what we've been waiting for and that's what
its all been about.  Yet I could see that it could appear then dissapear
quickly enough -- easily dismissed by Gorchakov as a mistake. Who knows how
T would play it.

One hint would be that when Eugenia is about to leave she tells Gorchacov
that he was "almost unfaithful" to his wife. This might mean that such a
moment had occured between them. If so the only place that seems to work to
me in the film would be very early, in fact I'd say in a second scene after
the visit to the church and before we see them waiting in the hotel lobby
at Bagno Vignone. Placing it between any two scenes after that looks
impractical... of course who knows what else may have been removed that may
have been in the original script. The only way that I see it fitting in
later would be if it appeared in one of Gorchacov's dreams but never took
place between the two characters.

Has anyone ever seen a script of Nostalghia? Of course even if the scene is
not in the script it still may have  developed on the set.

For my part I don't think it is needed in the film, so if it was removed I
understand why. We can see there's amourous tension between them so the
only reason to have it would be to make that more palpable, and such
gestures of sexual sensuality would throw the aesthetics out of balance.

Oooops..  I meant that last post to go sirectly to that person!  
Thanks everyone for the interest in my wee independent study proj.  The feedback you give will be helpful.  

Listmaster:
	Is there someway we can overhaul the process by which people get on the list?  The web page with the form for subscribing is nice and convenient, but it doesn't force folks through the process of subscribing, which teaches one how to unsubscribe, right?  I left for labor Day, and came back with 1/3 of my email being 'take me off this shit' etc. :(  I love this list and read through it at work, but repeated similar emails draw attention from our web guy! ;)  The list is a blast, though, and I'm glad to be on it!

	So..  In this paper that I have sent a few of you, I discuss pacing a bit, and relate it to pacing in music.  I go through a few brief examples where there is great activity in the midst of relative calm (eg first half of sacrifice up to the flyover/pitcher crash) and bring up the question of manipulation of time by the composer/filmmaker.  He conscious accelerates the pace in a unique way via this graceful shifting, without resorting to a regular , steady, more active pace.  Thoughts?

Kee-rist!  I'm having a hard time emailing DIRECTLY to some of you, and
can't figure out why!  I'll go ahead and post it to the list in the
following message, since about ten people wanted a copy.  Thanks in advance
for your feedback!

Hey Rey


I assume you mean the thirty seconds of weightlessness where Kelvin,
Hari, Quixote, candelabra  etc float past -- also we can see the
Bruegal paintings in the background. 


Is this what you are asking about?

If so, perhaps I am due to re-post my "levitation for love" email from a few

<x-rich>Hey Ben


You focused on some of my favorite tark parts. I got a quick question
on this passage.


<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>In Sacrifice, Japanese
music is mixed ever so slightly into the soundtrack throughout the
film, most notably when Alexander visits Maria and as he leaves the
house and burns it.  Obviously, this is musical in the same way the
repeated image is; it counterpoints other aspects of the film the way
voices interplay in

music.  Or is it analogous to orchestration?


</paraindent>The musicality of the image is a nice and elusive analogy.
Tell me more about your last thoughts in the last sentence -- which
repeated image, which other aspects and what's your thought about the
analogy to orchestration?


Good thought provoking stuff, thanks.

</paraindent>Reynaldo wrote me off list, he wasn't sure about the

Feel free to post your thoughts though...

In a message dated 98-09-08 12:37:49 EDT, you write:

<< silence in Tarkovsky's work creates an expanding slow-burn of
 tension which grows with the progression of the movie.  Tarkovsky allows
 deflation of the tension only gradually, with little exception. >>

Hi Ben,

Glad you pointed this out.  This is what I find most seductive about
Tarkovsky's cinema:  those excruciatingly, lasciviously long takes with no
immediadte gratification, no rapid catharsis.  Can anybody recommend other
pictures with this quality?  (except Kourismaki, though I liked "Ariel") And
did everybody hear that Kurosawa died?  A moment of silence...

Though I don't think it works as well Sokurov (sometimes called Tark's
protege) uses silence a great deal--almost exclusively (Mother and Son). I
would recommend any film by Yasujiro Ozu--especially Autumn Afternoon and
Tokyo Story. While his takes are not as long as Tarkovsky's, they share that
same meditative quality you are describing here. And silence is ever so
important. Scenes in Ozu's films are like a series of haikus. Mike Leigh has
recently moved towards the long take, though with more of a realist's interest
in documenting relationships than Tark or the aforementioned directors--still,
great stuff.

Yeah, it's a little shame that nobody in the list remembered the death of
Kurosawa, isn't it?

dear Akira, rest in peace..

This has always fascinated me:  the story of men using technology to acquire
information, but finding nothing is revealed about the subject, only about
their private agendas.  I'm ashamed to admit I don't recall the scene in
question, I'll go back to it.  This point is what the whole film hinges on for
me:  the way external quests lead one always back home, to the self, to the
unadmitted guilt, the suppressed pain.  As mystical as Tark can get, he's
really tangled up in the psyche, very complex, which can also mean
"unenlightened" (cf. Rob't John "Transformation" -- 3 types of consciousness
-- simple, complex [aka neurotic], and enlightened).  I hope I don't get
struck by lightning...

I can see that.  That is certainly one reason why Tarkovsky had those
paintings hung there, to serve as a reading of Kris. Thinking about
this makes me think of Solaris as Tarkovsky  himself! He is like any
author/creator who begins with a central character then builds the
surrounding society in a way to express something about that
character.


What you are saying comes across best I think in the scene where Kris
finds Hari lost in thought staring at "Hunters in the Snow".  I see
this as an action of the ocean because it seems to me that Hari
<italic>ultimately is Solaris herself</italic>,  blossoming in the
benevolence of Kris' kind projection. As time goes on Solaris is
understanding Kris -- and humanity -- more and more.


A theme I see a lot in T is how closely connected humans can be to one
another, how they overlap. In spite of the sort of pessimistic thought
that we only seek ourselves "out there" -- that we project our own
objects of love and hate upon one another -- here is an example of how
a projection (Kris' Hari) upon another being (Solaris' Hari) produces 
a "visitor" who apparently achieves a greater conscious development
than any of the previous "visiting" incarnations.  


Kris' powers of creation has become as impressive as Solaris'.  This
phenomenon is not science fiction.


"How wonderful!"

I think everybody remembered Kurosawa. When I heard about his death, I
couldn't stop thinking about his movies. Ran, I like the most. 
Everybody remained in silence, but I'm sure he will be always in our
memories.

	Sorry, Tarden, but there is not too short a characterization when
speaking of Ozu to say simply that his films are like a series of haikus?
And what about the goolash-like films of Istvan Szabo?

  >>

Fair enough. I could, frankly, speak of Ozu with intense fondness and
admiration for about ten years only stopping to renew my breath. Remember: I
was recommending other director's, not doing my usual by putting the "anal"
back in analysis. Still, as I said, fair enough:

Some people complain that Ozu's shots are too static and standardized. Most
takes last a minute/minute and a half or so and feature little or no movement
(unlike Tark with his tracking shots). Moreover, the camera is almost
constantly set at three feet above the ground. One of my favorite Ozu moments
is in Autumn Afternoon. The father of the story works in an office. After some
beautiful (and, yes, haiku-like) establishing shots,  30 second Ozu shot set
in the hallway outside the office shows a secretary walk by. We then see the
father in his office sifting through a stack of paperwork. Later on in the
film the series of shots is duplicated, but very subtly, giving the gradual
impression that the film has started over again--and, also, that the
character's life is tedious and repetitious.  

When I say that the shots are like haikus, I mean that like haikus they are
deceptively simple. The point of a haiku is to, without gimmickery, capture
the essence of a moment. One famous addage used by Basho or Buson (maybe
another celebrated haiku writer) is that a haiku is like a finger pointing at
the moon, if the finger is covered with rings and jewels it distracts from the
moon. Ozu does this for me: he is never melodramatic, not even close. He never
uses the camera in ways that draw attention to the camera itself. Orson Welles
once said that Vittorio de Sica (I think he was referring to Shoeshine in
particular) could do the one thing with a camera that he himself could not do:
make you forget it was there. This is true of Ozu, as well. His camera is not
cold or dispassionate, it is simply unintrusive. I suppose that Joyce's notion
of "symapthetic detachment" best describes what I mean. Like Chekhov, Ozu
gives each character all the love and attention they deserve--too many
directors save their love for the technique of filmmaking.

As per Szabo's goolash-like films--This, too, is too short of a
characterization! (I suppose you were sort of poking fun at me . . . again,
fair enough) But now it's your turn to expand on what you mean. I, for one,
have not seen any Szabo and cannot say--though I have heard that several
Hungarian directors have experimented with unbelievably long takes.

Thanks, Davide!  Cool post with inside info, another reason why I love the
net, I'd never bump into somebody with that information at the supermarket (or
if I did it would never surface).

Great discussion of Ozu.  I loved Autumn Sonata.  I'm just finished
editing my own personal "best of" Tarkovsky discussion from the
high-energy spring of 98 to distribute to friends.  For me it is a great
moment of found art/criticism.  Perhaps we could have an autumn edition?

I must tell you, I no longer collect entries.  Is anybody doing that? 
I'm too busy now and I'm tired.  However, I would like to publish that
incredible spring rush in some form someday.  It may be impossible due to
copywrite difficulties.

I tried showing Nostalghia to a well-educated (loves Cocteau's Beauty and
the Beast and Orpheus and Antonnioni's La'Ventura and Fellinni's La
Strada) art friend the other day.  She found it heavy-handed,
self-serving and so intrusively autobiographical that it interferred with
her willing suspension of disbelief.  

It is so rare that anybody says anything negative about Tarkovsky (on
this list) that I just thought I'd share it.

What your friend said negative about Tarkovsky wasn't really about T,  it
was about herself, lack of so many things...

Thomas!

Welcome back, mon frere! I have been, somewhat pathetically, waxing
nostalg(h)ic (pun intended) about that splendid renaissance we had early in
'98 for weeks now. The list is in somewhat wanting shape right now, though
Scott has been his good old formidable self--keeping the list alive almost
single-handedly. 

I can't tell you how glad I am to see you back. With you and Scott both
posting again and with some of the new additions we've had in the last few
weeks, I think an autumn rebirth is a distinct possibility (if seemingly
unnatural).

I'm glad, too, that you saw Autumn Afternoon. 

I'm not sure if anyone is collecting the posts of the last few months--I have
been relentlessly deleting almost everything in my archives, Tark or not.
Perhaps you could send me your personal collections as a text file? 

I mentioned your idea that the wife (etc.) in Solaris were, essentially,
icons--perhaps you could explain the idea more fully as you know that film
much better than I do, and have the Orthodox perspective as well.

I feel suddenly compelled to say marvelous sweeping things, but find that I am
uninspired. 

Let me be the first to welcome you back!

Hey Charles,

Good to hear from you again. Hope things are going well up there in Tenn.

I've got the back log, by the way. It's been pretty uneven going. Perhaps
things will be picking up around here now that you and the Seamiester have
returned.

I've been thinking about this and think that there is some truth in your
friend's observation. There is a preachiness about Tarkovsky that can be
intrusive--I have always grappled with these weaknesses since Nostalghia and
The Sacrifice are both my favorite films by Tark and also his most openly
opinionated work. Holding to the aesthetic that Realism and Joyce's
"sympathetic detachment" (which I have somethow managed to mention twice in
one day), that is, some sort of artlessness, are the ideal, I think that
Tarkovsky has some problems. But I am not as convinced as I once was that this
aesthetic ideal is necessarily to be worshipped. There are some great artists
who break this very rule almost incessantly--Dostoevsky, Celine, Proust,
Rimbaud . . . There are times when an artist's consciousness is what appeals
to us as much as their craftmanship--that is, that sometimes it is what a
person says about the world that is more important or beautiful than their
abilityto re-create it. And yet, Tarkovsky is also a master-craftsman in his
camerwork, etc . . .

So there must be another distinction. Perhaps it is characterization. In the
later films I find that Tark's psychology is stronger than his
characterization. I hope I can make this distinction clear: Tark probes minds
well, but there is more to people than their moods--and so much is left
unexplored. Again, I think of Dostoevsky--so often his characters are best
seen as aspects of one greater mind. The brothers in Bros K, for instance,
have always struck me as aspects of a mind that Dost is analyzing: the
intellectual, the hedonist, the faithful one, the repressed Evil One . . .
Perhaps there is something like this in Nostalghia and The Sacrifice (even
Stalker . . .)

Tarkovsky seems to have carved out a very select philosophical/psychological
area for himself--one that cannot be judged fairly by the old art for art's
sake aesthetic. He is honest in placing himself within the work itself, in
openly expressing opinions and placing them within the mouth's of his
characters. And yet, somehow, he makes it work.

I think that in general Tarkovsky works in an iconographic way.  He seems
to be interested in the  Platonic notion that things in this world are
smaller models of ideal things somewhere beyond.  These things are not
symbols.  They are copies of ideal prototypes and they participate in the
nature of these prototypes.  I really need to read Plato more carefully
than I have; I'm probably not expressing him very clearly.  Hari is his
most explicit example of this principle, but one can see it working
throughout his work.  In Mirror, the house and the mother and the wife. 
In Sacrifice, there is Little Man's model.  In Nostalghia Domenico and
Andrei are actually united in a Eucharistic way,  Andrei partaking of
Domenico's essence, becoming one with him.

When people write icons they actually work from a prototypical icon,
tracing off it to try to minimize innovation.  Well, gotta go.  Thomas

I would love to get the soundtraks. Is there any chance to buy them on the
internet?.

I need to ask you something, too.

The most of the discussion group are from the north hemisphere. Is anybody
from Southamerica or Down Under.
Here in Chile, there's so many tarkovsky "fans" (ugly word, in this case).
Last year in Viña del Mar and Santiago, they shown all tarkovsky films. One
film, each week. So we can GET the movie the right way. Early in the
nineties I saw Stalker, just when I heard Tarkovsky was dead. And the I saw
Sacrifice in video.
But after Solaris, something in my mind has changed. I couldn't explain it.


The thing I wanted to ask you is if you have heard about spanish subtitled
Tarkovsky videos. I can understand english, but any of my friends don't.
And if I show it to them, they have to understand the words for realizing
what the movies are about.

I didn't realise the Statue was designed by Michelangelo. 


Another long lost list member, Cokoliso, once said that: 


</fontfamily><paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>San
Galgano was a Sienese Cistercian abbey constructed by monks around
1218

to commemorate Galgano (a local saint who in renunciation of war,
thrusted his

sword upon a stone and pray to it as a cross/ something very
Tarkovskian to

ponder about).  The abbey flourished for some time, but the war
against

Florence by the Sienese, and lastly the plague during the middle
ages...wiped

out the abbey¥s population and soon the order and the church were
reduced the

ruins that were used magestically by AT at the end of Nostalghia. 


</paraindent>Here's a couple of questions I've had about Nostalghia:


1) Which St Cathereine is the pool nakmed after? Butlers "Lives of the
Saints lists no less than seven Cathereines. Concerning this Cokoliso
said : 


<paraindent><param>right,right,left,left</param>I have no idea where to
begin to look for it...although, we all know the saint was born in

Siena..(if it is the same individual)..San Galgano is about 12 miles
from

Siena...I have to do some investigation about this matter soon...I will
be

also visiting Siena this summer. Perhaps I¥ll find some mystical soul
who can

guide me to the right spot...


</paraindent>I await news of our good friends return. 


2) The other question concerns the folk song that we hear at the very
begining of the film. Does anyone know anything about this song. I
think it would be marvelous if some of our Russian literate on the list
would jot down a translation of the song.  I've loved this melody a
great deal over the years and would dearly love to know the lyrics. Is
it a well know folk song? It's a melody that seems suited for fond
memories... perhaps someone would like to share something they remember
about this song?

Frankly, I don't see the connection between the Platonic ideals and
Tarkovsky's creation. Thinking of individuals as a copies of some
prototype(s) is quite weird and even dangerous. That's very close to
Faschism (actually Plato thought positively of dictatorship of the "right"
leaders, namely philosophers).
So, it may be interesting to show some resemblance between, let's say T and
Platonic ideas or Ozu and Haiku poems, but if it's not backed by convincing
examples or other kind of strengthening, it's not worth too much and anybody
can easily throw "important" names in the air; it sounds very impressive,
but what really does it worth?!

Hi Thomas,

I get the prototype idea, but what is Hari a copy of?  The ideal Hari?  The
ideal young woman (young, beautiful, helpless, and dead -- Tark as sexist)?  

I'd also like to hear more about icons generally.

Haim makes a good point.  If you're on this list, you're probably a weird and
dangerous person already, (I certainly am) and the connections that are
obvious to you made be wholly unintelligible to others, so please explain your
ideas in detail.  In Thomas' defense, I don't think he was name-dropping.
Really, I think this crowd could get a lot more obscure than PLATO fer
chrissakes if we wanted to show off.

Hari is a copy of Kris's old girlfriend who committed suicide back on
earth.  That's really all I mean here.  However, she is also some sort of
embodiment of the planet.  I'm sorry if some folks find Plato fascist (a
little history lesson is in order), but those seem to be clear examples
of Ideal and prototype to me.

I am ignorant of Plato and ignorant of iconography and ignorant of
Tarkovsky for that matter.  I really don't have a whole lot to say about
any of it.  I'm kind of sorry I bothered again. I'm not a brother of
anything.  I'll listen.  Thomas

Hi Thomas,
Well, I didn't mean to insult you, so your reaction is a bit exaggerated.
Let me explain what I meant: Platonic ideal is something quite definite. For
example, take the notion of triangle. All the possible (or "physical")
triangles in the world have something in common, which is their "trianglity"
if I may say so. THIS is the ideal of triangle, more or less. Now if you
take this notion and use it on people you obviously should be careful. There
is a Platonic ideal of human being, but only a general one. There are not
many such ideals or prototypes and there are not personal or individual ideals.
I don't have any problem with what you wrote about Hari as a copy of Kris's
old girlfriend who is also some sort of embodiment of the planet. I just
felt very uneasy with using Plato as a source for explanation (you don't
have to agree with me of course, but certainly YOU are the one to explain or
give examples - only if you like, I mean - and not me, as you demand. After
all you are the one who made a claim. I just didn't agree.

>In Thomas' defense, I don't think he was name-dropping.
>Really, I think this crowd could get a lot more obscure than PLATO fer
>chrissakes if we wanted to show off.
>Sarvenaz
 
Sarvenaz, I didn't mean to say that Thomas is a name-dropper, but using BIG
names instead of explaining explicitly what you mean using your own words
opens the way for such an attitude. Personally I think it's not healthy.
Again, nobody should agree with me, but - I hope - it's legitimate to
criticize without getting into personal insults, as Thomas (and Seamus?)
did. And by the way, folks, the idea that Plato supported dictatorship (with
good reasoning in his openion) is not my idea but a common knowledge which
can easily be checkecd by anybody interested. Just open some books in
philosophy and look for Plato's ideas on state. Since he thought that the
state stands higher than the individual, I see his idea as facist, again as
a fact, not meaning to insult (Plato).

OK Thomas, don't get defensive.  Things get hot in here but you don't have to
take it as an attack on your value as a human being.  DUH she's a copy of the
real Hari, but was the real Hari an ideal?  No.  I've got no problem with
Plato (I don't always agree, but that's not a problem) but a suicidal bride
does not a prototype make.  Get your facts straight!

That's pretty much the textbook definition of fascist.  But who am I to talk?
I'm not only a fascist, I'm an elitist.  I think if we're going to have our
renaissance we'd better watch the films again.  

What I found striking about Solaris the film as opposed to Solaris the novel
was that first section with Kris in the woods.  The rain.  Going from the rain
of his childhood to a foreign ocean... water in Tarkovsky generally always
really cranks up my emotions, and I'm not clear as to why that is.  I don't
have the book at hand but as I recall there's no such scene in it.  There are,
however, VERY lengthy descriptions of the ocean's surface, which numbed my
brain.  

What's up with Tark and water?  It doesn't seem to symbolize the usual
Freudian things...

The use of the word "ideal" here does not mean "universal" or "perfect"
but simply that the origin is in the realm of ideas. In this case the
idea's prototype was in Kelvin's mind. It's projection was a copy of
his personal idea.  Like Hiam said I don't think Plato ever discussed
personal ideation... although others picked up the ball, so to speak. I
Can't give good examples, though. Augustine, Berkly..? It doesn't
matter, its self evident to me.


I also agree with Haim that it is dangerous... I think that's part of
T's phenomenological concern. Can our projections upon one another be
dismissed as misunderstandings... or could they be <italic>deadly? 


</italic>It's a closed system isn't it Thomas? If we sense that we
carry such deadly projectiles around in us we probably respond by not
leaving ourselves open to one other.  Not wanting to get hurt nor hurt
others but also not conducive to learning. This seemed to be Kelvin's
state of mind at the begining of Solaris, just as his father told him.
Hence Kelvin's submission at the end.

	Given the renewed interest - and even pasions- in platonism, I go
to post something on the relationship between platonic Ideas and 
things/persons in the world. Although not explicitly tarko, there may be 
some remote connection.
	The problem is "participatio": firstly we have the world of
phaenomena, that we inhabit in a sensual way. Secondly, the platonic
line of thought lead us to accept the realm of Ideas. In what concerns
thinking, it seems as if we live here. The problem of the reality -
whatever this may mean- of this or that world rests somehow on their
mutual relationship.
	Platonicly, the Ideas world is the more real. The phaenomenal
world gets reality inasmuch it is a reflection of the ideal upthere. The
World in itself is a humble reality and the soul should avoid mixing up
with it. But as a reflection - even through a glass- of the Ideas, the
world becomes worth considering. This may be so, for the soul is
encapsulated in the world and its concern is to get out of here. We
may think of the ideal realm as some natural place where the soul wants to
stay. As now, by reflecting Ideas, the world gets some transparence and a
road out may apear. Platonism is nostalgy ( pain of geting back).
	Some primitives hold that the world undergoes a continuous
disruption. The man should take its part in the restoration of the world.
This happens periodically. In "reality" this restoration is a creation ab
initio of the world. Maybe a new creation, from time to time? No, every
creation is nothing but the first one, that was out-of-time. This pattern
of thinking is platonic, and men get "really" into that time-without-time,
where the world may be an Idea at most.
	It seems to me that the incarnation of the Christ may be also 
taken as a relationship between the two realms. The Word comes into the
world. Although I can not elaborate on this, it seemed to me necesary to
point this out.
	One can easily find other relation mechanisms in the history of
ideas. Though it seems that none is so simple to reduce just to a scale
transformation. But then what to do with scale models in T's films? Should
they be copies of ideas? Or they should simply point out that beside the
world as we know it there IS a world of Ideas? That is, ideas have a
reality in themselves, they are not nothing. Or may it be simply that
Tarkovski loved cute little things and was so sympathetic towards them as
to put them in the film?
	
attila

	I do not know Plato or the platonists, but the concept of
platonism is so freely and widely used that it seems unavoidable. That is,
you may discard it but then you have to invent it again. Besides, its
archetipal content makes it very pleasant. So I apologize to all those
persons who use this concepts in an exact fashion.

Tark settles our squabbles from the grave, with Scott Rhodes as the medium --
now that's what I call a master filmmaker!!  

Seriously, actually I thought the most marked aspect of the planet's
creations, or enfleshings to use a juicier word, was that they did not
interact with one another at all, but only with the person from whose mind
they were conjured.  The easy interpretation is that they were created to
reveal more about their subject, or (more paranoiaclly) to torment them, but
by the film's end we find that they simply force Kris & the others to confront
them.  Each man responds in his own way:  by healing a wound, by going insane,
etc.  Solaris as an acid trip -- how did I end up here?

Projections not onto one another, but projections that exist only for
oneself...

Haim:

We all seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot. The fact that the postings I
read this morning were the most consistently interesting in months is more
than enough to convince to be a bit repentant at having possibly been
defensive, etc.

You write:

<<Again, nobody should agree with me, but - I hope - it's legitimate to
criticize without getting into personal insults, as Thomas (and Seamus?)
did.>>

Though it causes me indescribable grief to admit (without qualification) that
it is legitimate to criticize my ideas and attempts at expressing those ideas,
I do so openly. Sigh.And I suppose I did slip into personal insults by
agreeing with Thomas'  comparing Haim to Harm Snell (an old member of the
list), so I'll own up to that. 

Haim's criticisms, however, are not without reproach:

<< So, it may be interesting to show some resemblance between, let's say T and
 Platonic ideas or Ozu and Haiku poems, but if it's not backed by convincing
 examples or other kind of strengthening, it's not worth too much and anybody
 can easily throw "important" names in the air; it sounds very impressive,
 but what really does it worth?! >>

This is not much of an objection. To simply say that something is not
convincing is, itself, not convincing. What didn't convince you? I will stick
to the haiku example since it was mine and I am most responsible for it. In my
initial post comparing Ozu's cinematic rhythm to that of a series of haikus I
was DESCRIBING a director's style to another member of the list who was
interested in other directors who use long takes and/or silence in the their
films. As the old saying goes "Talking about music is like dancing about
architecture." The same is true of film--I can write until my fingers are
bleeding all over the keyboard and not be any closer to describing a film
accurately to someone who hasn't seen it. So, predictably, there was a degree
of failure in my description. When asked to elaborate, I did. I described
(with a supporting addage) the aesthetic of haiku poetry and then gave a rough
account of Ozu's own aesthetic by recounting a particular duo of scenes.
Apparently this was equally unconvincing. So it goes. However, if a criticism
is to be levied against my point, then something must be said that is
critical--which I distinguish from contradictory or contrary.

Instead I have been told that my idea is merely "interesting"--an odd
complaint, if I may say so. At the same time my idea is seen as impressive
sounding and, ultimately, worthless. I found that my idea (and or Thomas') was
so worthless that it actually required double punctuation to get across the
full degree of indignation ("?!")

But I'm getting snooty--not my aim. My point is this: Criticism should be
taken seriously when it has substance. The above quoted bit of criticism seems
to me to be little more than a veiled form of attack. I have attempted to take
it seriously anyhow. 

I'm still waiting to hear about Szabo and his goolash-like cinema. I'm
genuinely intrigued . . .
 
As I said, this morning I discovered a wonderful exchange between Haim and
Sarvenaz that seemed to me well thought out--I hope that this will be the
precedent that all of us follow. The point of this group is discussion--which
implies a certain amount of arguing. Good. 


Now, let's get on with something more interesting.

Seamus

First of all, I'm sorry I overreacted, taking offense and giving it in
return. I apologize.  Back in the late spring on the list, I was called a
fascist and a jew lover and told I had nothing worth saying.  The asshole
would post one sentence pooh poohs on everyone's hard work.  For a
misguided moment I thought that person had returned.  I am truly sorry.  


Everyone has said everything very well.  Farkas summarized what little I
know about Platonism very well.  Tarden with quotes and explanation
explained well most of what I was trying to say.  I must say that the
discussion has taken a dramatic turn up in intensity and I love it.  I've
started saving messages again, trying to maintain thought streams between
people.

I agree with the general tenor of Haim's view of Plato's politics.  They
creep me out so much that I keep putting Plato down when I should be
reading him.  I especially don't like his view of poets (being a poet
myself) and censorship (he's all for it).  However, fascism is a much
latter movement historically, and I doubt it has much at all to do with
Plato though I'm not sure.   I am fascinated that Hitler gave Mussolini
Nietzsche's  Power of the Will.  I'm also fascinated with one of
Mussolini definitions of Fascism:  Fascism is rule by the corporation. 
To me that speaks vols. about where the U.S. and it's spawn (i.e.
corporations) are headed.  But enough politics.

Anyway, I associate Tarkovsky with Plato primarily because of Nostalghia.
 Something Farkas just said makes the connection even stronger for me: 
	the soul is encapsulated in the world and its concern is to get
out of here. 	We may think of the ideal realm as some natural
place where the soul 		wants to stay. As now, by reflecting
Ideas, the world gets some 		transparence and a road out
may appear. Platonism is nostalgia ( pain of 	getting back)."
Because Plato taught the pre-existence of the soul it makes sense (in
that cosmology) that the soul could be nostalgic for it's true home. 
This seems to be what Tark is getting at in Nostalghia what with the 1
+1=1, the Russian home inside the church and the snow as a depiction of
Andrei's death.  For a guy who despises symbols, Tark lays 'em on pretty
thick in that film.

What I was saying about Hari and the model houses I meant to be taken on
a metanomic (metaphical) level.  Of course, Tark was not dealing in
Ideals and their earthly copies literally.  I was just trying to say that
all this semiotic (copy of a copy of copy) seemed metanomicly evocative
of certain Platonic ideas which we know from Sculpting and Nostalghia
that Tark had a fondness for.

Also, I happen to know, as an Eastern Orthodox, that Orthodox folks tend
to prefer Plato over Aristotle and the rest.  The Orthodox intellectuals
I know all write dissertations on Plato, etc.  Personally, I haven't read
much of the Old Greek, but as an "intellectual" who converted a number of
years ago from Western Christianity, I'm always getting Plato put on my
plate so to speak.  I also end up hearing many  "In praise of Plato"
conversations.  Santayanna once said, "I'm so stupid I'm almost a poet." 
Well, I am a poet!"  I can only work with image and metaphor---anything
abstract and I get lost.  However, when I started watching this Russian
Orthodox film maker, I expected to find and did find plenty of Plato
there.  If you compare what Farkas wrote with the Timothy Ware (he
definitely gets the Orthodox Housekeeping seal of approval) quotes on
iconography that Tarden (an athiest quoting my guys, what's the world
coming to) provided, you will see the similarity in world view.  In fact,
it is a common accusation that Eastern Orthodoxy is merely warmed over
Platonism and neo-Platonism.  However, not being a theologian I'm not
sure I can respond to that accusation.  Cheers  Thomas

Can you please explain what you mean by nature's doing?  I agree with you that this specific shot was not initially planned that way, but the cinematographer, Conrad Hall, after having placed his key light to shine through the rain-machine splattered window, noticed the effect on Blake's face and brought it to Brook's attention (they may have even shot a take before the effect was noticed, but I can't remember).
With Brook's ok, Hall went back and tweaked the lights to make the effect more pronounced. It was a simple situation of an attentive professional/artisan taking advantage of a "beautiful accident" (Haskell Wexler's term for such moments), recognizing that it would serve the subtext of the scene, and ultimately "creating a ghostly marriage of the external with the deepest internal." Though these lucky accidents are
always appreciated when they happen, it still takes a professional with extensive knowledge and experience to recognize and employ and manipulate all the necessary elements to their desired fruition.

 It is interesting to note that Hitler also made the most powerful
propaganda film of all times " Triumph of Will " directed by Leni
Reifenstal [Leni also directed the most beautiful olympic film]. Hitler was
almost a film producer too. More of Hitler and Cinema in the lengthiest
film I ever saw " Hitler - Our Hitler " by Spiberberg[?] from Germany. 
 
And Mussolini started the first ever film festival in Venice!!

Its funny how clear things seem in the sleepless night. 


I know no modern way of improving on the primitive notion of
sympathetic magic to illustrate T's sensual-body relationship with
water. Except of course to simply look at that image of Kelvin --
incapable of saying goodbye --  standing, then sitting in the rain. 
Don't we<italic> feel it?

<italic>Lacrema rerum</italic>  was an inscription Aenias saw in the

Yes Syberberg I've wanted to see that for years! 


May I ask where you saw it? Did you find any relationship to Tark ... 
although  I understand it has an impersonal style it's supposed to be
pretty melancholic and maybe even obliquely autobiographical about
Syberberg himself?



As an 'explaination' of Hitler much has been written about his trauma
during WW1 and his childhood. Tark's formative experiences are
similar... though T is diametrically opposed to Hitler, it seems to me,
in the sense that the bellicose choose to act on their projected
ideals... hero, enemies, nationality, etc. 


In all of the discussion of T's concern with ideals T was VERY
ambivalent about ideals. The miniatures in Nost belonged to a crazy
man, who presumably would have subjected his family to such
constrictions if he could.  In Sacrifice when Alexander finds the model
of his dream home he is clearly frightened. Quoting the line from
Macbeth suggests fear, guilt and betrayal. Some how the act of Little
Man building this model for his father is less than pleasing to Alex.
Furthermore the ideal home that he and his wife were captivated by was
soon to be toast.


One distinction seems worth mentioning. T appears to have a great deal
of respect for nature, the disparaged 'copys' I mentioned are all man
made. And even religion seems to fall into this category of ambivalence
(granted, it's a complex subject Thomas!) But it's questionable whether
or not<italic> natural objects </italic> are "copies" in T's scheme. No
demiurge to blame? So perhaps his films are not Platonist, nor Gnostic 
-- but not exactly humanist either.

Hey Reichart


Thanks for filling in the gaps in the story.


This reminds me of the time I attended a workshop with Stan Brakhage
wherein he spent a great deal of time talking about all kinds of things
like "closed eye visions", his relationship with the muse and what it
was like to be a mountain man during the beat generation. Of course I
loved every minute of it but having established all that I wanted to
ask him for some insight into the problem of dealing with the
<italic>bazillion  </italic>technical distractions  -- those logistics
of being on a film set that so easily drown the subtle voices of
inspiration. 


<paraindent><param>right,left</param>"How do we leave ourselves open
enough to allow the muse..."


"Allow...?" He interrupted "<italic>Allow...?"

</italic></paraindent><italic>

</italic>He then went on for another long time explaining that the muse
is not at our disposal, that the muse is like the "Prom Queen who casts
a glance our way if she sees fit." 


Fair enough. I suppose its sort of misguided to ask for sensible advice
from a guy who claims to work in a trance. 


Like I said, this notion is difficult for me to understand and convey
in my modern mind. I think it has to do with the fact that this state
of mind, this disposition toward the world is so easily crushed that
those whose livelyhood depends on it are reluctant to mess with it.
Also you just can't beat that "eurika " experience of self discovery so
it shouldn't be pre-emted. In My opinion, its easier for poets who work
alone to stay quiet, but in a collaborative medium like film we are
face with finding ways to talk to those we work for.


I guess we could safely say that nature conspired in this creative act.
 Hall's vigilance on the set was exemplary. Yes you are right that it
is a<italic> simple</italic>  situation of an attentive
professional/artisan taking advantage of a 'beautiful accident' -- this
one would have been difficult to miss in the eye piece I suppose. But
it's a good illustration of how life seems to tap into our themes, help
us out, don't you think?


Over and over T conveys the idea that showing up for work with a
preconception is no way to create art. He even goes on to say that the
artist has to get out of the way. I like to think that it's consistent
with this to disregard the whole notion of "unconscious" origins of an
artist's creations and imagine that all these things come from outside
us, we are <italic>inspired</italic>  in the original sense of the
word. 


You probably see what I'm getting at here. I hope I haven't over
simplified things, none of this sounds very impressive until it happens
to us. As a matter of fact it just sounds silly. But these are the
things that make our day, no matter what kind of work we do. Maybe it's
what we live for. It's sort of a religious idea but wasn't it nice when
we used to <italic>know </italic>that the stars corresponded to the
body, that we were <italic>at home  </italic>in the universe? 


Of course it also made us feel more uniquely vulnerable and paranoid
but that's another matter....

	I must confess plainly that I am very sorry for posting that
goolash-like stupidity. I knew that your comments have always a solid
backing - conceptual, personal feeling or whatever. This got confirmed
when you explained your position in more than three words. I saw two
Szabo films some years ago, but not get any impresion to remind now; he
simply occured to me as subject for a shallow judgement mixing national
features in a ready-made style: romantic Frenchmen, rational Germans ( or
better conversely?), haiku Japaneses, cool British, goolash Hungarians.
	But in fact I am not so sorry. I think seriously that I should try
some Ozu haikus.

Seamus, I admit that I should be more specific; actually I didn't object
your idea. I just thought that it wasn't backed well. But rethinking of it I
agree with you that "Talking about music is like dancing about
architecture", so it can't be really explained. It's a matter of taste and
imagination too, maybe. The only doubt I can think of is that haikus are
very short, and Ozu's shots are generally very long - havenig a long-long
"breath", so they seem not to have the same tempo. But again, I appologize
for putting everything together carelessly.

Thomas, obviously I'm not that guy, and I hope it's all over. I agree with
what you wrote about Farkas, who summerized very well the Plato subject.
Actually I didn't mean to talk much about facism, which is not much related
to T, but you're right about that it was interesting (though provocations
can be unpleasant too).

the recipe:

1+1/4 cups matzoh meal
5 lg. eggs, separated
1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt
1 tablespoon vodka
1 tablespoon chicken broth
1/4 cup vegetable oil
4 quarts chicken soup 

1.  Beat egg whites until stiff.  Add matzoh and yolks, combine.  Add salt,
vodka, chicken broth, and oil and mix well.  Let stand for 20 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Roll the matzoh
mixture into golf-ball sized portions.  Drop into boiling water and simmer for
20-30 minutes.  
3.  Heat up the soup, add matzoh balls (makes about 15-18) and serve.

Happy New Year everybody!!

Haim, you write:

<< Seamus, I admit that I should be more specific; actually I didn't object
 your idea. I just thought that it wasn't backed well. But rethinking of it I
 agree with you that "Talking about music is like dancing about
 architecture", so it can't be really explained. It's a matter of taste and
 imagination too, maybe. The only doubt I can think of is that haikus are
 very short, and Ozu's shots are generally very long - havenig a long-long
 "breath", so they seem not to have the same tempo. But again, I appologize
 for putting everything together carelessly.
  >>

Yeah, the haiku thing was really for descriptive purpose more than anything.
You're right about the lengthiness of course--and haikus are anything but
lengthy. I was thinking more of the apparently simplicity of both.
Whatever--it's really not that important. I'm glad all of this has been ironed
out and that we can move on with a better understanding of each other's
methods, etc. And anyhow: not all of us have time to sit around writing full
formulated theses.

Water in Tarkovsky: this question was broached recently by Sarvenaz.
Oftentimes (and I think the Tarkmeister himself mentions this in SWT) water is
emblematic of time passing in his films. Consider, for instance, the stopped
clock in the jar of water in Mirror--one of the shots that Tark considered
overtly symbolic. I think, too, that this is why water is so often associated
with decay and detritus (Stalker, Mirror, Nostalghia)--time wears down the
physical world. Oftentimes, money and weaponry are seen immersed in
water--Tark's comment on the temporality of such things.

But this idea breaks down when one notes the presence of art within these
pools as well (in particular the van eyck painting in Stalker). On the whole,
I think that tark's use of water is as fluid as water itself. Tark, of course,
denies the use of emblems in his films--not very convincing, but worth noting.

Nostalghia is particularly water logged (the Petrie book makes this
observation). I have no idea if one meaning could be assigned to water in this
particular film. I doubt it.

Some time ago there was an attempt at compiling (her on this discussion group)
a sort of concordance of various repeat symbols in Tark's films: horses, dogs,
milk, water, and so on. At that time I posted on what i called "levitation for
love" using an article from SIght and SOund as my basis. IN that article Tark
was quoted as asking someone (while making the Sacrifice) which director had
best reproduced the sensation of being in love on screen. He quickly answered
that it was himself, in MIrror, when we see the mother levitating above the
bed, the husband beside her. Levitation, Tark suggested, best captured the
unreal floating sensation of love. He used it, then, once more in The
Sacrifice--Alexander and Maria (the witch) floating above the bed.

But I think that it is a dominant motif in Tark's films. If anyone has my
original post (Scott? Thomas?) I'd like to see it re-posted (it has better
documentation than my current ramblings). Here, though, is a rough paraphrase
of my idea:

Ivan's Childhood: the scene where the soldier kisses the other (female)
soldier in the woods, his legs on either side of a ditch, holding her in mid-
air. This is interesting since he is not in love, but she is. She is floating
but he is not--and he is the one holding her up (leading her on).

Andrei Rubilev: the opening scene with the peasant flying in the makeshift
balloon--a bit of a stretch, but worth mentioning.

Solaris: An easy one: the 30 seconds of weightlessness between Hari and Kelvin
as they dance the waltz of love through mid-air. (sigh)

Mirror: (already explained)

Stalker: the big hole in my theory. Any ideas--I can't think of a single
goddamned thing.

Nostalghia: the daydream image of G's wife, pregnant, and floating in space on
the bed--one of my favorite shots in all of tarkovsky.

The Sacrifice: (already explained)

Any Ideas?

And yes, "happy new year" or, as my younger sister used to say as she was
learing to talk: "happy new you!"

	I remember now that the " levitation for love" image was also used
by Terry Gilliam in his Barron Munchhausen ( the barron dances with Venus,
floating up to the ceiling in an amourous trance). It seems to me ( I can
not remember) that this motive recurred in The Fisher King also ( Robin
Williams dances with his love in an overcrowded marble hall).

What if one morning an Azande tribesman had opened his eyes and woken up to "energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared?"  Would he have gone out and killed a chicken to expose the culprit of such bewitching nonsense, or would he have shrugged his shoulders and gone back to sleep?  Or would he have locked himself up in a room, turned his back to the definitions and expectations placed upon him by his society, and spent a lifetime attempting to decipher it -- obsessed with this singular vision...'building a series of tiny
metal fishes' like in Garcia Marquez's A HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE?

In one degree or another, we are all inspired; I think it is just a function of our abilities and experiences and insights that determines how far we are able to elaborate and build upon our litany of inspired moments -- this is what separates the truly gifted from the merely inspired.

"...the problem of dealing with the bazillion technical distractions -- those logistics of being on a film set that so easily drown the subtle voices of inspiration." The more technically proficient you are the less of the need to concentrate on such matters and the more you can delve and focus on what is at the heart of your aesthetic search; and in certain cases, where the modes of expression are insufficient or have been exhausted, a good grounding in technique may enable you to have the resources to create a new language, a new
technique, a repostulating on the way to see and hear,  so as to ultimately communicate as fully as possible what is inside of us.

So, yes... the muse is like the "Prom Queen who casts a glance our way if she sees fit." But only a few of us will have the courage and ability to ask her to dance, and succeed; and fewer still, at the end of the night when the festivities are over, will be able to take her to a hotel (in the back of a car; home; forest; alleyway; wherever...) and bang the hell outta her.


> In My opinion, its easier for poets who work alone to stay quiet,

It is the nature of all who work alone...and yet,  if we peered inside the mind of a poet wouldn't we be bombarded by an effusion of questions, doubts, shouting matches, and diatribes about the process of creation...not unlike the chaotic nature of some movie sets?

> but in a collaborative medium like film we are face with finding ways to talk to those we work for.

Yes, as far as communicating what we want and expect of our collaborators, and finding a clarity  and specificity in the expression of the desired elements, but it still doesn't mean nor does it require that we reveal our motives or explain ourselves...our choices can and do sometimes remain a mystery to our collaborators (and sometimes to ourselves).

>  I guess we could safely say that nature conspired in this creative act. Hall's vigilance on the set was exemplary. Yes you are right that it is a simple situation of an attentive professional/artisan taking advantage of a 'beautiful accident' -- this one would have been difficult to miss in the eye piece I suppose. But it's a good illustration of how life seems to tap into our themes, help us out, don't you think?
>
> Over and over T conveys the idea that showing up for work with a preconception is no way to create art.

And yet, as is shown in DIRECTED BY ANDREI TARKOVSKY, he often works from preconceived elements and is angered when certain pre-arranged details haven't been carried out to his satisfaction or expectations (i.e.. see the lashing Anna Asp gets for not delivering the goods.)  Furthermore, the fact that he has agreed to a certain color scheme, the casting of specific individuals, choice of location, set construct, b&w or color, etc., is all a process of preconception. And what are we to make about particularly complex shots that require a
lot of preplanning?

Cinema is after all an amalgamation of different disciplines, all of them intertwined, sometimes in support and sometimes at odds with one another, but ultimately all employed in the construct of some Truth.

 Also, as we all know, Tarkovksy was operating from a very specific aesthetic ideology and infused all his decisions, whether planned months ago or at a moments notice, with his prejudiced convictions.

> He even goes on to say that the artist has to get out of the way. I like to think that it's consistent with this to disregard the whole notion of "unconscious" origins of an artist's creations and imagine that all these things come from outside us, we are inspired in the original sense of the word.

I don't agree. After all, Tark 's films are not a function of indeterminacy or Chaos Theory or algorithmic formulas...etc.; rather they are a construct of the artistic interplay of temperament and context -- this symbiotic relationship sometimes gives precedence to the artist  in allowing him to exert his will and overriding influence on his surroundings, and at other times it is the external forces that allow the artist to step back and react.  A fugue...

And, as is so obvious by Tark's employment of repeating motifs and obsessions throughout his films, Tark rarely got "out of the way."


>  You probably see what I'm getting at here. I hope I haven't over simplified things, none of this sounds very impressive until it happens to us. As a matter of fact it just sounds silly. But these are the things that make our day, no matter what kind of work we do. Maybe it's what we live for.



> It's sort of a religious idea but wasn't it nice when we used to know that the stars corresponded to the body, that we were at home in the universe?

"...used to know..."???  We are all carbon based beings; we carry the origins of the stars inside of us. We are the universe.

Yes, I have always been intrigued that Eastern modes of thought seem to take
over toward the end of the film--or at least around the period of the
sacrificial burning of the house. Not only the shakuhachi music and the taoist
robe, but the entire landscape suddenly begins to resemble the waterlogged
rice fields of Asia. Alexander even takes a zen-like meditative pose at he
watches the house burn down. Your idea of the merging of the three elements
(really all four if you included the, later, burning down of the house) is
very convincing.

Here's something I've always wanted to mention and just remembered to: when
Alexander's wife sits down, in grief, to watch the home burn down she assumes
a very interesting pose. She is beside a puddle with her legs to one side and
leaning on her elbow (something like that). I remember seeing The Sacrifice in
the theatre with a friend--it was the first time either of us had seen the
film since going to see Nostalghia (twice in a row) a month or so earlier. As
we sat there, watching her laying there we both suddenly gasped. The shot was
a reversal (that is, shot from behind) of the final shot of Gorchakov in
Nostalghia as he assumes an identical pose (beside a puddle) facing the
audience, his home behind him. In Nostalghia, of course, the home has (in a
sense) been restored (via the death of the character). In The Sacrifice the
life of the character(s) is restored via the destruction of the house. This
seems to me to further link these two films in an interesting way . . . but
I'm still at a loss as to what the meaning might be.

Another interesting thing about that shot of her watching the house: if you
pay close attention you can catch a match cut. That is, what tark apparently
did was have the actress (Fleetwood?) sit very still until the house collapsed
from frame and then cut out much of the interim while still making the shot
look continuous. I didn't even notice the slight shift until I'd seen the film
for billionth time or whatever it was. I'd always wondered how Tark got the
house to collapse on cue.

Yes, also, to the levitation for love in Baron Munchausen. I haven't seen
Fisher King in so long that I just flat out don't recall anything save the
samurai hallucination. Perhaps Gilliam is a Tarkovskyite. One American
director who shows some influence from Tark (more than some really) is David
Fincher--not intellectually (unfortunately) but visually. I've always meant to
check this: but I know that Fincher began as a director of music videos for
Madonna--one video featured a rip-off (hommage) to both Stalker (the scene
with Monkey moving the glasses across the table was reporoduced) and
Nostalghia (a statue of the Madonna with birds flying out of her chest).
Unfortunately, I don't remember which song it was for. Fincher's mainstream
films also show (subtler) influences from Tark--the use of water imagery in
Se7en and the religious imagery in Alien 3. The Game, too, seems to have some
similarities to Stalker--though with some Hollywoodizing, to be sure.

I realize I haven't supported myself all that well in the last section. I'm
still thinking the issues through. It's also been awhile since I watched much
of Fincher's work.

In a message dated 98-09-18 16:18:12 EDT, you write:

<< So, yes... the muse is like the "Prom Queen who casts a glance our way if
she sees fit." But only a few of us will have the courage and ability to ask
her to dance, and succeed; and fewer still, at the end of the night when the
festivities are over, will be able to take her to a hotel (in the back of a
car; home; forest; alleyway; wherever...) and bang the hell outta her. >>

But is that necessarily such a great thing?  The prom queen's consort usually
ends up as a fat, bald used-car salesman by the time the 10 year reunion rolls
around.  Maybe instead of lusting after inspiration or divine assistance, you
should ask out the mousy girl who came stag -- it's practically a cliche that
she'll end up being powerful and respected:  ie invest in your own mind and
labors!  

And we all know what happened atthe prom in "Carrie"... (heh heh)

Well said. Or as John Mclaughlin once told Robert Frip: "One must learn

I don't think <italic>ideology</italic>  is the word I'd use but I
don't disagree. It's interesting in the doc when he mutters "we have to

>"...used to know..."???  We are all carbon based beings; we carry the

If that's how you<italic> feel</italic>  then we have no argument. You
are a better man than I. I know what you say as a fact but I feel too
much frailty for it to have any grounding. That doesn't mean I wouldn't
try to rise to the occasion in the alley behind the dance hall...
though I'd probably pull an Onan on her. 


BTW,  may I be forward enough to ask if you were simply being
rhetorical or if you've ever really ravaged a muse so thoroughly? What
was it like?



I've found T and his films to be an amazing compounding of oppositions.
 He seemed sometimes to go out of his way to insure contradiction and
paradox. You and I are just orienting our perspectives in two views
that may seem exclusive but both are important in their respective
contexts, I think. These are delicate points and sometimes have to be
articulated somehow to help give them a place in our day.  


I'm not sure what T would want us to learn most by studying his work.
Maybe to make us better observers of our own lives, I guess. I will
never hear a table saw again without thinking of <italic>Nostalghia.
</italic> Frailty and fear that I might cut off a finger makes it
imperative to watch closely, to move slowly, carefully... I don't want
to miss the point.

Thanks Rey,

Yes -- It's one of my personal favorites. It has an irrational effect on
Kelvin, reducing him to tears... it's worth waiting through the whole film
just to see it all climax in that scene.

How wonderful!

Thanks, I was worried that I would sound insane. After so many viewings I
really wonder sometimes if I'm not becoming overtly Qabalistic about the whole
thing. The only reassurance for me at the time was that my friend reacted in
the same way--mass hysteria?

Sorry you're in such a rush today--know how it is, though. Maybe you can
figure out a connection. I'm stumped.
 
"This rocks the house."  Well, either that or burns it down.

I have a question about a film like Tarkovsky´s.
	Four months ago I watched a film like Tarkovsky´s.
	It is about a boy that lives in a house, and he can get out of the
house.
	The house is his world, and he meet in different days other people.
This people were stranger and indiferently. But he has a best friend and a
lover that help him. 
	Sometimes he meet a crazy man, a gipsy, and a father that tell him
to search the answer for the house.
	I didn´t watch the end because I had to sleep.
	 
	Anyone know what film it is and the director?

	Other film, that I think is similar as Tarkovsky, is the performance
of Sthepenwolf. (Herman Hesse) Aren´t you?

	D.

	PD
	Excuse my english, I´m don´t have my dictionaries.

Hi everyone, my name is Pablo and I have been lurking in this wonderful 
list for about six weeks. Will be posting soon. Meanwhile, what follows 
in Spanish is an outline of what's been discussed in the past few days.

Javier,

En todo caso los "limitados" son los que jamás tuvieron la dicha de ver 
una película de Andrei Tarkovski.

Lo que se viene exponiendo ultimamente es sobre el valor simbólico del 
agua en las películas de AT y sobre la asociación de las escenas de 
levitación - en todas las películas salvo Stalker . con un sentimiento 
de amor profundo. Esto entre otras cosas.

Si quieres enviar un mensaje a la lista, lo traduciré con todo gusto. Lo 
mismo si quieres que traduzca algún mensaje en particular.

Un abrazo,


Pablo

Seamus, Scott, S, Sarvenaz et al,

My name is Pablo, I live in Buenos Aires and have greatly enjoyed 
Tarkovsky's films.

I have noticed that ever since some people started posting messages in 
Spanish (and latinized Russian), most of you have stopped posting which 
is a great pity, at least to me. Bear in mind that this is no War of the 
Tongues, but rather that many people simply cannot write confidently - 
or at all -  in a foreign language.

On to another subject. Have any of you read Marina Tarkovskaya's "On 
Tarkovsky"? (1988 Progess Publishing House - Moscow - don't know if it's 
been translated) If so, I would like to read your comments. If not, I 
will gladly post a few morcels now and then. My Russian is pretty poor, 
so I'll cheerfully put up with any translator-traitor flames.

Jump back in, the water's fine, especially here in the southern 
hemisphere where spring began yesterday.

Pablo

Ola' Carlos,

Yes, I think it must be like night and day to see Tarkovsky on the big
screen after you have seen him only on video. Maybe Fantas will host a
retrospective one of these days.

I have seen four films by Oliveira. A Caixa, which i liked, The Convent,
which was ok, Voyage etc, which really had some nice moments and has found
a US distributor (mirabile dictu), and Party, which i really really
disliked.

Why does Oliveira do films like Party with people speaking a really silly
affected kind of aristocratic French? And why oh why does he insist on
casting Leonor
Silveira in every recent film. She is very lovely, but can she act? It
seems a personal obsession of his, and a man his age deserves his personal
obsessions, but enough already!

I prefer Joao~ Monteiro's films, though I have only seen two: Comedy of
God and The Pelvis of John Wayne (but just for the parts where *he* is on
screen. I have seen lots of other Portuguese movies too....Ossos being the
best one i can remember apart from Monteiro. 

Nina

Well, hmmm, if Scott Rhodes stay silent, please get me out of his tits. 

What do you thing about Robert Bresson ? I saw recently "Au hasard
Balthazard", and I found it good well, but i prefer "Mouchette". 

Please, don't answer to this mail if you've got some
two-cent-self-theories. Just want to find someone who can watch movies
without two-cent-self-theories-after-movie (around a cup of coffee, or
a beer or a white wine glass or a good mauresque (L'abus d'alcool est

I think Scott said he was on a trip somewhere and would have to be silent for
a bit. And as Scott goes, so goes the list . . .

Pablo, you write:

 notions about WWI.
  >>

Yes, Gallipoli is a great example and brings up the First World War--one war
that, somehow, was not as glamorized when it was over as others. True, the
silent film era has an number jingoistic films--especially from Hollywood. But
All Quiet on the Western Front seemed to quickly eliminate the ability for
such films to succeed without being seen for tripe. Another excellent film
(similar, thematically, to Breaker Morant) is Kubrick's second film, Paths of
Glory--not only is it not glamorous, it is bitingly cynical. Since then, most
portrayals of the First World War have been (to varying degrees) condmenations
of war and brutality. Often it is used as a backdrop-- as in The English
Patient, or the very funny and sweet King of Hearts. The latter film was more
or less using it as a metaphor for Vietnam. For those who haven't seen it, I
recommend it highly: a soldier during WWI is the first to come across a small
town, not realizing that  the only people who have not evacuated are inmates
of the town asylum.

Enough rambling for now.

posting to the list when I'm dead drunk?"

Cheers,

Também achei ótimo Tarkovski em espanhol. Leio muito bem o espanhol, mas 
não escrevo quase nada em espanhol. 

Sou brasileira, de São Paulo. Curso uma discilina de pós-graduação sobre 
Tarkovski na Universidade de São Paulo. Estou estudando como Tarkovski 
utiliza a cor em seus filmes. Se alguém quiser continuar esse diálogo 
escrevendo em português, em francês ou em espanhol, estou às ordens. Se 
tiverem dados bibliográficos sobre o assunto cor na fotografia estática 
ou em movimento, fico desde já, muito agradecida.

An old listmember (Simon Kyte?) did some research on this a while back and, I
think, had no luck. Check the archive, though. Maybe something will come up.
